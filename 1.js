exports.arr = ["Don't go where you aren't invited and don't take things that aren't offered, Aries.

Before you know it, you will be invited everywhere and offered all the things you desire.",
"Attend to your duties today, Aries. There's a pronounced sense of time and a feeling that the days are slipping away. Make sure you fit love and romance into the equation somewhere. At first you may experience a bit of resistance in this department, but see that as an indication that this is an area of your life that you need to explore and ultimately feel more comfortable with.",
"Today is a great day to check off all the items on that list of yours, Aries. Get it done. At the same time, realize that your emotions might be a bit clouded and that things that seem genuine may actually be just a mirage. Issues of a spiritual nature are of primary concern. You should make sure you're nurturing this side of your being. Think with your heart.",
"You're going through a time of great preparation right now, Aries, You're building the foundation for a major life project. This period isn't to be taken lightly. The day's energy brings this importance into focus. Make sure you're building with bricks and not straw, and that the mortar you use is strong. Try not to get discouraged by negative emotions. The situation is probably better than it seems.",
"The morning might find you sitting like a stick in the mud, Aries. People might be getting down on you for not contributing, but tell them to be patient. You will be raring to go by nightfall. The catalyst may come from an outside source. Be on the lookout for a challenge. Someone might rattle your cage a bit too much, so be patient and don't take it personally.",
"Close relationships should grow closer today, and new relationships become close ones. You're likely to feel extremely warm and loving toward most of the people you know, and they should reciprocate that feeling. Romantic relationships, especially, could grow more intimate and physical. You like the way you feel, Aries, but want to express it outwardly through gifts or intimacy.",
"You may not be sure what to think today, Aries. Mental confusion could be the day's theme for you, but don't let it get you down. Realize that it's just one of those days when none of the pieces fit right. The truth is that they do fit somewhere, just not now. Lay low and wait for this phase to pass. Things will pick up soon as the fog lifts and you can see clearly again.",
"Discussions with those close to you could lead to the discovery of new concepts, perhaps from foreign cultures. You will want to learn more about them, Aries, as will your friends. You might even decide to plan a trip to a place where you could expand your knowledge of this new interest. Any trip planned today should go smoothly and be quite rewarding. Don't hesitate.",
"Unexpected responsibilities could interfere with plans to take a trip of some sort. Someone might need your help, and you may well have to put your own activities on hold for a while. This could be frustrating, Aries. It only delays whatever you're doing but doesn't stop it. Take care of whatever you need to do and then continue with your plans. You will feel better if you do.",
"Too much reading might have you experiencing eyestrain and possibly headaches, Aries. It might help to have your eyes checked, but it's probably just too much stress. You might have some trouble focusing on whatever work you do today, but this is only a temporary condition. You should be back to your normal self tomorrow. Stay home tonight, listen to music, and take it easy.",
"A prominent male author whose work you enjoy might publish a new book. You may consider doing some writing of your own, particularly if you have a story to tell. On a more mundane level, your day could require that you spend a lot of time in the car or on the phone when you'd rather be reading. Be sure to schedule time to relax in the evening.",
"Books and conversations with friends could take up most of your day, Aries. The intellectual stimulation could have positive and negative effects on your health. Positive because it raises your enthusiasm and puts you in an enthusiastic state of mind, and negative because it might get you so excited that you forget to eat or rest. Enjoy all the excitement but don't forget to take a break.",
"You could be expecting an important letter, call, or email today, Aries, and sit on the edge of your chair waiting for it. This might be from a friend or lover. It could be delayed, and this might get you flustered. Distract yourself and do something else while you wait. If you make good use of the hours, the time will fly by.",
"This is a great day to start a partnership of any kind, as it will prove cooperative, rewarding, and stable. Any legal papers executed today should definitely work for you, Aries. If you've been thinking about signing up for a class or workshop, this is the day to do it. You're more likely to get the results you want. Make plans for travel, too. You've got a lot to think about.",
"If you've been thinking about writing, teaching, or pursuing a career based on the dissemination of information, Aries, this is the day to look into it. Your mind should be especially quick and sharp now. You will seek every possible detail that could shed light on the pros and cons of making such a change. Your heightened pace can also benefit whatever work you're doing.",
"Today you might work on a lot of writing, Aries. It might be your own or editing the work of others. You could find what you're doing exciting and stimulating. Phone calls to interesting people could also take place. The only caution is don't tire yourself out. You could be on such an intellectual high that mundane matters like meals slip your mind.",
"Your practical skills should be operating efficiently, Aries. A creative or intellectual discipline that fascinates you might require some intense concentration today. You could spend much of the day in the library. You will want to take meticulous notes, but don't worry about it if you don't quite catch everything. Your memory should be sharp right now.",
"Some deeply buried feelings about your mother and family could come up from the past today and need release. Don't be afraid to show your pain and anger.

By the end of the day you might feel as if a large weight has been lifted from your shoulders.",
"Take a break from your daily routine and get off the treadmill today, Aries. The world will turn without you for one day, so tune out for a while. Remember that whatever path you take is the right one. Regret is a useless emotion. Don't even bother with it. Enjoy the present day and all the small joys it has to offer. Communicate your dreams and bring things into balance.",
"A co-worker could call you today, Aries, but you probably won't be able to figure out what this person is trying to say. Your colleague's mind is a bit muddled now, and he or she might not be able to explain the situation very well. Be patient. Sympathy and understanding are probably what's called for. You're the best person for that right now.",
"You might try to learn a new computer program today, Aries. You could find it a little confusing at first, but as you continue to learn, you will find that it makes things easier for you. You should master it more quickly than you thought. This may sound minor, but it will improve your productivity from now on, leaving you time to explore other possibilities or attend to important matters.",
"Today you may take a look around your home and see what needs improvement, Aries. A pending visit from a friend or relative may provide the incentive to get things in shape. A fresh coat of paint and some new window treatments and rugs will make a big difference. If you don't have time for that, fill the house with flowering plants as an effective camouflage.",
"Prosperity isn't just around the corner - it's here, Aries. Your finances are looking better than ever. Don't rely on this money, however. The whole point of a windfall is that it's unexpected, and thus can be used for luxuries or indulgences that you wouldn't normally allow yourself. If you begin to spend a windfall before it arrives, it's no longer a windfall but just another paycheck.",
"You can look forward to a busy day, Aries. Don't schedule any additional tasks. Your home, family, or mate is likely to demand a great deal of you. In fact, Aries, your energy is likely to be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve for yourself. If you give yourself completely, you're likely to strain your nerves.",
"Some problems might arise with equipment that you use at home or with the structure of the house, Aries. Appliances might go on the blink or the plumbing or electricity could require repairs. This could be a drag. It might involve staying home to wait for help. Still it must be done. Find a good book and settle onto the couch. You won't have to worry about this tomorrow.",
"Job-related or personal projects are apt to come to a head now. Success is in the air, along with a marked increase in income and acknowledgment from those who matter. This, of course, is going to boost your confidence, not to mention your mood. You might already be fired up with plans for new trails to blaze. Try to stay focused. You won't want to miss anything.",
"This might be the perfect day to go out, Aries, or stay in and turn off the phone. Friends and relatives could be stressed, and phone conversations could touch off some misunderstandings and cause unnecessary hurt feelings. If you must talk to people, keep the conversations light and brief. You won't want to mar a nearly perfect day.",
"The approach of a very special visitor might cause you to thoroughly clean your house, Aries. Afterward, you could look for new and interesting ways to dress it up with some new plants, throw pillows, or other decorative touches. This can be tiresome, but definitely worthwhile. When your friend arrives, he or she will feel at home. Work hard and then make yourself look great.",
"Now that you've earned your place in the world after all your hard work, Aries, you might take some time to pursue your own interests. This could involve writing or publishing, going back to school to get an advanced degree, or taking a trip around the world. You have the time and energy to think about all your different options, so don't feel you have to rush.",
"The desire to improve your home's appearance might suddenly come over you today, Aries. Whether you're planning some redecorating, landscaping, refurnishing, or simply a thorough cleaning, you will probably take the bull by the horns and concentrate on nothing else. The results will speak for themselves. Get family members to help you. You won't want to be too tired to enjoy what you've done.",
"Changes you're making at home might necessitate your planning extra time, Aries. Perhaps you're waiting for a guest whose plane got delayed, or your shopping trip takes much longer because you can't find what you're looking for. Whatever it is, don't panic. Just try to stay rational and think about other options or alternatives.",
"You should be especially efficient in whatever work you need to get done today, Aries. Your natural eye for detail is especially sharp.

When the work is all done, you might reward yourself by making some definite plans for a vacation you've been dreaming about for a while.",
"Have you been thinking about attending a seminar of some kind, Aries, perhaps business related? You and a partner might go together. This is a good time to do this, as your thinking is particularly clear and retentive and you find it easier than usual to concentrate. Discussions with your partner afterward could be the icing on the cake. Tomorrow you will feel like you can take the world by storm.",
"A quick survey of the financial news might reveal that your investments, particularly those involving property, might be worth far more than you thought, Aries. This might make you wonder if you should sit back and let it all mount up or actively put it to work for you. Consult a professional before taking any immediate action. You will want to be sure you're doing the right thing.",
"A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Aries, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.",
"Your focus today is likely to be on learning. Something you've wanted to study for a long time may finally be within your grasp. Perhaps money makes this possible, or you've finally settled on a workable course of action. Travel might be involved. If you've been thinking about going back to school, get everything started today. If you do, you will probably attain what you want. Go for it.",
"Discussions in a group you're affiliated with could get heated as disagreements escalate. A goal you've been working toward might finally near fulfillment, Aries, and tempers are short. You may avoid arguments, but the situation could still make you uncomfortable. You might decide to leave early and go for a workout or walk. This is a good idea. You will want to work off the frustration.",
"What meticulousness, Aries! You may feel a sudden, urgent need to take a close look at your financial situation, wardrobe, cupboards, or car. List the things you need to do in order to fix them over the next few days. You're going to spend your day taking inventory in your life. Why not? It's important to get a really good look at the reality of things occasionally.",
"You may feel like you need to work for a cause or political party, Aries. The period you're in right now is bringing you closer to social issues or humanitarian causes and pushing you to think about what you can do for people less fortunate. You can help develop a new strategy as far as human relations are concerned. Don't hesitate to listen to your heart and be a little more generous in life.",
"You and your friends may have been planning a party for some time. Now you realize it's entirely up to you to actually make things happen, Aries. It seems that if you're going to get anywhere, you need to take charge and delegate responsibility. You like to be in this position. Your great creative mind could give you a load of ideas for a party that no one will forget.",
"Friends or a group with which you're affiliated could want you to help them formulate a workable plan for advancement. You're in just the right frame of mind for this, Aries, and therefore willing to roll up your sleeves and pitch in. You might be the center of attention at some point, perhaps sharing your skills with associates. Don't forget your own goals. They could be advanced today, too.",
"Today you may contemplate changes in your home. They could be physical, like redecorating, refurnishing, or remodeling. Or someone could move in or out. Whatever the change, it's likely to be fortunate. If you're thinking of such a change, you can proceed confidently. You should be feeling especially inspired now, so be creative and manifest whatever has been on your mind for some time.",
"Aggressive people may interfere with your plans today, Aries, so don't get too upset if things don't work out the way you want them to. Let this be an exercise in learning how to think and act on your feet. Remember that you can play this game as well as others. Deliver an unexpected surprise right back and see how they deal with it. Perhaps you can learn something.",
"You may feel a bit protective today, Aries, and with good reason. Others are likely to be aggressive when it comes to moving in on your territory. Be strong. Assure yourself as well as those in your charge that everything will be fine. Take reasonable precautions, but don't completely close yourself off to the outside world. That knock at the gate could just as easily provide much-needed help.",
"A phone call may come from someone you know is prone to gossip, Aries. This person may have a lot to say, but be sure you take it with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. Your skepticism could prove invaluable in this respect. If what this person says is important, check out the facts before passing it on or taking any action. Chances are it's exaggerated or completely false.",
"The bizarre nature of the day may leave you feeling a bit bewildered, Aries. Don't sweat it. Focus on your romantic nature and incredibly nurturing heart. Use your instinctive healing abilities to care for a close friend in need. Today is an especially good day to connect with others and openly share your feelings. Confide in people you trust. Consider calling your mom.",
"A romantic evening at home with your partner could bring you two closer together, Aries. Your emotions are intense right now, however, so you need to use your intuition to judge exactly how much of your feelings you should reveal. An intellectual passion could also come your way. You might discover a new field of interest, and you will want to study it at home for hours.",
"Some rather depressing information could come to you today from far away, Aries. This is less likely to be about your immediate situation or circle of friends than it is about something social or political in nature. It's probably the subject of a lot of talk around you. You might need to run some errands in your community, but for some reason you can't. Relax. Tomorrow should be fine.",
"Changes in your home could cause temporary frustration that creates some tension with family members. Perhaps you're moving, cleaning, or refurnishing, and everyone is getting in everyone else's way. The best way to handle this situation is to try to get the job done as quickly as possible. Once it's done, Aries, tempers will subside and all will be fine.",
"Today a deep concern for others' feelings could have you lending a sympathetic ear to those in need of some understanding. It's more important to listen than talk, Aries, even though your practicality might want to express itself. Your affairs should go smoothly, bringing you and those around you a lot of satisfaction. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears of joy at some point.",
"Today is a great day for you, Aries. Everything is flowing your way as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Your fluctuating emotions are grounded and calm, letting you stand back and evaluate your true inner state. Have you been giving yourself the attention you deserve? This is your day. Get things done. You can accomplish quite a bit using this astral energy, so hop to it.",
"Romance blossoms for you today, Aries, and commitment or marriage may be just over the horizon. You and your beloved may have recently reached a new understanding that has bonded you more tightly. Don't feel silly if you spend the day together walking around in a romantic haze. That's perfectly acceptable - it's part of the joy of love, and it could well last for a while. Make the most of it.",
"A project could be successfully completed today, Aries. Discussions may already be taking place about the next one, but you aren't inclined to think about that, at least not right away. You will want to bask in your accomplishment and relax for a while. No one can blame you for that, so don't worry if you don't go to brainstorming sessions. Wait until it progresses beyond talk.",
"Watch out for the green-eyed monster today, Aries. It can rear up before you can say \"jealousy.\" Most situations that cause these feelings are born out of insecurity. If you aren't secure in your job, relationship, or family, and feel threatened by someone, it's time to take a look at the cause. Why you don't feel as solid as you could? What's causing the insecurity? Look for the answers.",
"You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and lying today, Aries. In some circumstances, this can be difficult, especially if you're afraid you will hurt someone's feelings. Keep in mind that a lie can take more energy than the truth. Consider what you would want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your morals and ethics even if it's tough.",
"If you feel cautious today, Aries, don't be alarmed. This can be a good thing, Aries, as you can be too trusting at times or forget to take care when going into something new. Use a little caution in everything you do to keep safe. This is true with relationships, too. Give a little more thought and time to things to help you choose more wisely.",
"This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Aries. The arts will likely be very important to you. You may find that nothing brings you more pleasure on days like this. Consider putting this to good use by painting, sculpting, doing crafts, or whatever you like. You will find that engaging in creative activities with a focus on giving may be the perfect thing for you.",
"Are you satisfied with your current career, Aries? If not, start by making a plan. There are specific steps that you can follow to take the greatest advantage of the available opportunities. Consider visiting career-related websites or ask a career counselor for advice. Don't settle for less than you deserve. See what you can find, and move toward a more fulfilling future.",
"You might feel more energetic than you have in a long time, Aries. The day's planetary aspects offer a powerful energy that will increase your mental acuity and physical strength, and this can really help you tackle and finish any tasks that have been piling up. If you manage to accomplish so much that you have time to spare, help others lighten their load. Tend to your own first, however.",
"The good news is this - it gets better. There could be some trying times in store, Aries. If you're a parent, the children will ask for something every five minutes, and you may feel pressure from all sides. Not even your love life is immune from the doubt that seems to hover over your head. No compromise is possible for you, Aries. Just sit tight and know that calmer days are coming.",
"You may find that your instincts are right, Aries, particularly where other people are concerned. You and a friend could come up with the same words at the same time, which might be a little disconcerting for both of you. Still, this increased intuition is likely to help your understanding of those close to you more than you ever expected. Make the most of it, and remember what you learn.",
"Being of service to others is important, Aries, but make sure that you're taking care of yourself, too. Turn up the heat and let yourself expand into other worlds today. There may be an extra amount of dramatic flair that goes along with the events of the day, so participate in the absurd. This may be exactly the break from reality that you were hoping to find.",
"When it comes to love and romance, things are definitely in your favor, Aries. The thing to be aware of today is that there might be some manipulation on the part of someone close to you. Take care that someone else's need for freedom isn't negatively affecting your relationship. Communication is key in order to maintain a healthy romance at any level.",
"Chances to pursue opportunities to bring whatever creative work you do best to the public could come up today, Aries. This might involve performances, exhibitions, trade shows, or festivals - anything that involves a lot of attention from the public. You will be in the limelight and outshine almost everyone! This is likely to be a lot of fun. It should definitely boost your ego.",
"A new and previously unacknowledged talent for working in social, humanitarian, or spiritual fields could come to light today, Aries. This could have you thinking seriously about changing jobs or pursuing an entirely new career. The opportunities are there if you look. If you're serious about this change, it's best to pursue it now. If you wait too long, the process might prove more difficult.",
"Expect some changes in your household today, Aries. You could finally be making some repairs or remodeling or redecorating. It's also possible that someone could move in or out. A visitor could also come to your door with interesting information that could change your life in some way. Whatever happens, don't expect a peaceful evening at home. There's likely to be a lot of activity!",
"You have a unique opportunity to review plans and foundations that you've recently put into place, Aries. As carpenters say, \"Measure twice and cut once.\" This is a key time to review your plans and make sure your structure is secure. If there's any doubt about what you've completed so far, consult someone whose expertise you trust. It may be worth it to start over using a new plan.",
"Your gracious, tender nature is likely to be extremely appreciated today, Aries. You may feel as if your head is so far up in the clouds that you can't get anything done. The truth of the matter is that the work you need to do is actually found up in those clouds. Trust that you've taken care of the foundation. The thing you need to do now is relax and let your fantasies lead the way.",
"Too many communications may prove distracting today, Aries. The phone could be ringing off the hook and your email inbox overflowing. Everyone around you seems to be talking at once. If you don't bring some order to this chaos, it could give you a headache! Let voicemail get the phone, get away from the computer, and take something light to the park to read. You need some peace and quiet.",
"You may be a bit on edge emotionally today, Aries. You're likely to feel less self-confident than usual, and you also might be a bit bored. In addition, you might have an exceedingly oppressive and tedious task that needs doing. Try easing the stress by listening to music and taking frequent breaks. Treat yourself to a good lunch. You won't help anyone if you work yourself to a frazzle!",
"Your intuition and imagination are operating at their peak today, Aries. Don't be surprised if you get the urge to write or paint. Even if you don't have all the necessary equipment, get started anyway. Scribbles in a notebook can easily be copied onto more formal material later on. What's important today is that you get started. You're likely to produce something wonderful!",
"A fabulous career break could come your way today, Aries. It could be a raise, promotion, or even a new job in a new field. It could also involve a completely different location. The work you will be doing may be unlike anything you've ever done before, and that's a challenge. Don't worry! Change is necessary if you're to reach your maximum potential. Go with the flow.",
"A member of your household who's recovering from an illness could express appreciation for all your help, Aries. This might come as a surprise because serving your friends is second nature to you. Rest assured that whatever you've been doing has made a big difference to this person. Relax in the knowledge that you're loved, wanted, and appreciated. That can keep you going in the future.",
"A letter, call, or visit from a lover or close friend is likely to bring interesting news your way. Your creative energies are at their peak, Aries, so why not try writing, music, drawing, or painting? You will have to squeeze this creativity in between many errands, because the planets indicate you will take many short trips today.",
"A long phone conversation could take place between you and a romantic partner, Aries. You could discuss philosophy, current events, the weather, and your opinions. The only thing you probably won't touch on is the status of your relationship, which could be frustrating for you. Nonetheless, you will learn a lot about your feelings that will enable you to understand each other better.",
"The healing of some childhood traumas could be triggered today, Aries, perhaps through contact with someone who knew you then. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears. This is a normal release. You could also suddenly laugh like crazy. Once this is all done, take your friend out for the evening and kick up your heels. That will help you lighten up and enable you to sleep.",
"Discussions with close friends could lead to ideas for creative projects of some kind, Aries. Although the projects themselves may center on writing, music, drama, graphics, or teaching, today's brainstorming is likely to center more on business and marketing than artistic matters. Nonetheless, you could walk away feeling inspired and motivated. Write down your ideas.",
"You're gifted in ways you don't even know about, Aries. Today you may uncover that gift unexpectedly. Perhaps you doodle a silly drawing in the margin of a note to a friend. Studying it reveals an idea that would be good for a children's book illustration. Perhaps there are other things you could do with your life. Research other possibilities online.",
"If you wake up this morning and feel glued to the bed, perhaps that's where you should spend the day, Aries. You've been working hard and long these past few weeks. It only makes sense that your body would rebel eventually. This is a day for rest and relaxation. The office will survive without you. Call in sick and then turn off the phone. You're likely to sleep better than you have in a long time.",
"An unexpected visit from a gloomy or depressed person might have you feeling a little disconcerted, Aries. Don't try to be too cheerful. It's more important to be a good listener. You might also be a bit on edge today and jump at sudden noises. Take care not to read too much into it. This oversensitivity is only temporary and should pass within a few days.",
"An increase in your financial status could lead to changes in your household. You might choose to redecorate or purchase new furniture or move to a better place. A household member might move out. Although it seems illogical, Aries, the changes in your surroundings reflect the transformations taking place within you. Don't let fear or inertia hold you back. Go with the flow.",
"There's an emotional intensity inside you today that's squirming to find a way out, Aries. Sudden outbursts are likely, so take care to hold your temper in check. Surround yourself with good friends who can support your erratic feelings. Don't be clingy. Seek friends who are thoughtful listeners, not permanent crutches. They may be feeling the same strong tension and don't need an extra burden.",
"A relationship with a close partner may get a bit confused, Aries. You could react quickly to a situation without really thinking before speaking. There may be some confusion in your mind about whether to stay silent or take a more aggressive route and blurt out everything you feel. It's important that you find an equal balance of both.",
"You might be feeling somewhat under the weather, Aries. You're probably stressed and in need of rest. Work concerns could also be confusing. You might have a lot of tasks to do and not be certain where to start. Maybe you shouldn't start today at all. Perhaps you need to take the day off to rest and then tackle it tomorrow when you're feeling like yourself again. Think about it!",
"Reading could take up a lot of your time today, Aries. Books on psychology or the occult sciences might seem interesting, particularly as your intuition is operating on a higher level than usual. You might not want to talk about what's coming up for you, but that's OK. You will need to make sense of it first before you can share it with clarity.",
"Things may be coming to a dramatic climax for you, Aries. It may seem like everything is working against you. Take note that this is an excellent time to find balance and gain a much greater perspective on the issues in your life. If you're trying to figure out where your heart and brain are hiding, you should look on the opposite side of the world. They're over there discussing things together.",
"If you haven't gotten the love you want lately, Aries, perhaps it's because you haven't asked for it. If you're involved with someone and feel unfulfilled, consider having a heart-to-heart talk about your needs and what you want out of the relationship in order to be happy. If you aren't in a relationship now and want to be, you need to be more aggressive about getting to know the one you want.",
"You may have to consciously let go of some of your plans, Aries, and simply leave things up to chance. The element of the unexpected can help you out quite a bit, so work with it instead of trying to keep it at bay. The natural flow of events should lead you toward a place of greater freedom. Use your imagination instead of relying completely on mental processes like logic.",
"An opportunity to do some extra work outside the scope of your regular job could present itself to you. Take it, Aries. Not only could you earn some extra money but you might also open new doors that expand your professional horizons. The only danger is that you might work too hard and tire yourself out. It's OK for a while, but don't make a habit of it. You need to conserve your strength.",
"Even though you feel most comfortable when things are organized and meticulous, Aries, you're going to need to be flexible. Allow room for surprise and adventure. Bask in the adventurous spirit that must be adopted when you walk out the door with no idea where you will end up. People and situations that come around today are likely to be foreign but friendly.",
"Today may be filled with conflict when your legs carry you one way while your heart tugs you in a completely different direction, Aries. Don't get caught in an uncomfortable situation like this. If you move around on automatic pilot all the time, you may end up missing out on the things your heart truly longs for.",
"If you've been thinking about going back to school for a degree of some kind, Aries, this is the time to start the process. Success and good fortune through your own initiative and through increasing your skills are definitely indicated now. A journey you've wanted to take for some time may finally be possible, as could achievements in the fields of writing and speaking. Go for it!",
"You're likely to be very aware of things going on around you today, and you may internalize the opinions of others, Aries. Be careful about opening yourself up so much that you get hurt by someone's offhand, unflattering comment. You will find the most comfort in tangible and stable things. Enjoy the material pleasures in life.",
"You may get frustrated today when people don't seem to act rationally. To you, Aries, the issues may be perfectly cut and dried. Keep in mind that not everyone sees the world the way you do. There's an element of strong emotion that's likely to play into the picture, an element that you probably failed to take into account. Make note of this as you go through your day.",
"Information about possible careers and investments might come to your attention today, Aries.

"Emotional conflict is likely to ensue today if you aren't careful, Aries. People may step on your toes if you give them the opportunity. Make sure you aren't vulnerable to attack.

"A discussion could take place in your home between you, friends, and household members, Aries. A love partner may also be present. The conversation will concern controversial issues that the people feel very strongly about, so expect to hear intense debate between opposing views. Your guests will take more of an intellectual than argumentative stance, so you can relax and learn. Have fun!",
"You may be thinking about political or social matters today, Aries, specifically, the deterioration of the planet. You may be worried about your future and that of your children.

If you need to get further involved raising people's awareness of this issue, do it!",

"You aren't one to put much stock in the meanings of dreams, but you may have had a dream recently that was so accurate in its prediction as to be almost scary. Certainly it was uncanny.

It's more than likely you will receive some telling insights.",
"Your creativity is at an all-time high, Aries, so take advantage of it. This would be an ideal day to paint or write.

You will be delighted with the results.",

Keep yourself busy.",

"Has someone given you a chore to do and then taken off without giving you any instructions? It's no wonder you feel confused and frustrated! If there is no manual, and if no one else knows what's up, don't feel bad about letting it go until you're given proper coaching. It's more prudent to wait than do it wrong and have to do it again. Better safe than sorry.",
"There will be a lighthearted, almost silly energy in the air today, Aries. The Universe is encouraging you to give up your iron grip on that list of responsibilities and have some fun. Picture all the pressure you put on yourself as a ball and chain that you need to unshackle. There's no reason to take yourself so seriously all the time!",
"Although you may pride yourself on your patience, Aries, this quality could be hard to come by today. It's possible that you've bent as far as you can and reached the breaking point.

You should take time to evaluate where you are at this stage and nourish this part of your being.",

Make sure you're ready to accept the challenges that come with growth.",
"Some of your job responsibilities are too much for one person and they might weigh you down today, Aries. The pile of work seems to get steadily bigger no matter what you do. Delegate if you can. Put the least urgent tasks aside and work your way steadily the rest. Your employer may or may not expect too much of you, but you're entitled to your sanity no matter what.",
"The outlook for today is excellent, Aries. The current alignment of the planets and the somewhat oppressive atmosphere of the past few days inspire you to change your surroundings and visit new places. Why not plan a little trip?

Don't worry about possible failure.",
"An unexpected but welcome financial windfall could lead to some long-desired changes in your living situation, Aries.

These are all very positive changes that will make a big difference in your life.",
"A scandal concerning a celebrity you admire could be in the news today, Aries. This might throw you for a loop. You might even suffer some disillusionment. Withhold judgment for the time being. Much of what you hear may be traced to gossip or misinformation. Shocking though it may be, you will want to hear the celebrity's side of it. Only then can you form an objective opinion.",
"This may not be the most energetic day, Aries. You've been working hard lately and your body needs time to refuel. Spend some quiet time at home.

This would be a fruitful time to strategize creative changes you'd like to make at home or work.",
"It's frustrating when work gets in the way of romance and social activities. This is what you feel today, Aries.

That way you will get through the day without making yourself crazy.",
"Your intuition is operating at a high level, Aries, but you may not be able to make sense of the psychic impressions you're receiving.

Write them down and look at them in a day or so. You should be able to make sense of them then.",
"You might have trouble with your plumbing today, Aries, particularly if you have a big kitchen. This is too complex a problem to handle yourself.

"You may feel wanderlust and crave something new and different in your life. You just can't help but be a bit bored by the dullness of the routine.

You're bound to learn more about yourself as you study this particular area.",
"Too many invitations to social events may come today, Aries. This might be one evening when you want to relax at home, but you won't want to say no to anyone. Analyze each invitation.

"You're looking good and feeling great, Aries. Now if only your home environment reflected who you are. As you look around, you may realize that it isn't as elegant as it could be. Today you can begin to change it. Begin with the basics - tidy up and clear away clutter. Once all the extraneous items are gone, you can begin to look at more serious changes.",
"It's likely that you will succeed at whatever you set out to accomplish today, Aries.

You may find he or she has the same feelings about you! Honesty is important today.",
"This isn't the time to make any more of a commitment to your relationship, Aries. You aren't satisfied with your attitude toward things lately.

That is a very precious skill.",
"Your energy might turn toward beautifying your home, Aries. Perhaps you've decided to repaint or go in a completely new direction in your decorating taste.

Expect someone to drop by and bring some interesting news that might get your mind going a thousand miles an hour.",
"Whether or not you should make a specific expenditure could cause some tension between you and a partner, Aries.

Wait a couple days until you're both a bit less tense.",
"This day may not be one of your favorites, Aries. You may be all too aware of the constraints of your chief occupation. You're likely to hanker for appropriate rewards for your labors.

"You could write fiction or journalism well today. There's a good possibility that you have given some thought to a literary line of work. Why do you hesitate? It's never too late. Find the time to write a story. If you have a negative attitude about the things you do, how will you get anything done?",
"You're a helpful person, Aries, yet in your relationships, you often seem to confuse helping with parenting. You tend to do a lot of self-sacrificing.

If you do this, you may rediscover something essential you may have lost along the way - your ego.",

Today's one last burst of determination and inner power could complete the process and reach the goals you want.",
"You may feel nostalgic as you look through photo albums, rearrange furniture, and remember past times, Aries.

Honestly face these feelings now instead of stuffing them back down for another decade.",
"Try not to get too caught up in any potential conflicts brewing around you, Aries. Your job lies in calming things down and bringing a more practical perspective to the situation.

Step back from the fire instead of throwing yourself into it headfirst.",
"You may be called upon to host a gathering in your own home, Aries. At first this could throw you into a panic because you don't think your house is clean enough. Don't worry. It's probably impeccable. You're the only one who will notice any dust, so don't sweat it.",
"Excessive food and drink could have you feeling rather sluggish and indifferent to everything. This can get in the way of your usual kindness and affection, but it shouldn't. Get some rest, take a stomach remedy, and get back to your old self! You might also be tempted to overspend at some point. Think about it first!",
"You may feel more of an urge than ever to search for your family roots. Your search could be so deep and intense that you may even go beyond genealogy and study archeology as a way to learn how to bring some cohesion to the odd bits and pieces of family remnants that you uncover.",
"Authorities who have been your guides up to now may confront you. The hour is here to set aside your fears and lead yourself along your path. This is undoubtedly a very positive state of affairs.

"Today you might feel a little under the weather due to physical and emotional stress over the past few days. Take it easy today if you can. This isn't the day to be too busy or start new projects.

"If you were in charge of a company's human resources department, Aries, today you would begin to completely overhaul the recruitment procedure.

Confidence in people combined with trust in your instincts could prove profitable in more ways than you imagine.",
"Aries, you can expect the day to be a bit bumpy. If you were an Olympic athlete, today you'd be standing at the starting line, wondering if you had trained enough for a topnotch performance.

"If you have ties to any therapeutic profession, Aries, you may make a strange discovery related to the health field today. You won't find this discovery in any book or methodology that you normally follow. Emotions aren't so blind as rational society would have us believe! Sometimes they lead us down the road toward knowledge. That's the case today.",
"Recent hesitation on your part may have suddenly put you in a bind, Aries. It may feel like you've reached gridlock and your choices are limited. You can no longer get a solid handle on things.

"You may not know which way to turn, Aries. You may be emotionally weighed down by sentimental feelings and memories that bind you to the past.

Try not to let your thoughts get tied up in either of these scenarios.",
"How do you preserve your family history, Aries? Do you keep mementos in a box, display heirlooms, or make scrapbooks?

Take steps to record and save precious items and memories from parents, grandparents, siblings, and others. Don't forget your own history, too. One day you will be glad you did.",
"Try not to get too worked up over other people's actions that don't concern you, Aries. Recent events may have triggered responses from others that now have a serious effect on you.

You will find strength in your calm, grounded self.",
"Today is a day of reckoning in some ways, Aries. Attention to detail is important, but make sure it doesn't become your only focus.

Take care of anything that needs a broader perspective.",

You need a bit of reassurance. There are a lot of interesting things inside you that need to come out. Believe in yourself.",
"Aries, you will have the opportunity to set the record straight with some of your relatives.

"Success on all levels is filling your life and making you feel absolutely wonderful, Aries. The downside of this is that you might be a little too conscientious. Are you putting in a lot of extra hours? Be discriminating about this and don't work harder than necessary. You could get stressed to the point of taxing your strength too much, and that won't help you. Pace yourself.",
"You've been doing very well, Aries, but today you might feel more focused than ever. The path ahead seems clear and well defined. You're anticipating the future with motivation. You might be considering a long trip abroad or perhaps going back to school for an advanced degree. This is a good day to research and finalize your plans.",
"More than usual, you're probably craving solitude today, Aries. Although you may have committed to attending a party or get-together, now the idea may seem irritating. You may rather work on some tasks or projects, or you might want to go for a workout and release some of the tension you feel. The latter idea is good. If you exercise early, you might feel like going out later.",
"There is a conflicting push/pull aspect to today that may leave you feeling unsure about how to proceed. On the one hand, you may feel like you want to plan things out and get your emotions stabilized so you can function at full capacity. On the other hand, something may be pulling you into the clouds. This is your heart talking. Listen. Find a compromise between these two energies.",
"Today you might hear about opportunities to increase your income, Aries, either in your current employment, a new job, or perhaps by a project of your own. You may channel a great deal of energy and inspiration toward this end. Others may want to pitch in and help you. You're likely to feel energetic and optimistic. This can work in attracting still more new opportunities.",
"Today is your day to shine, Aries, so give it your all. Be sure that you get the credit you deserve for all you do. Try not to fall into self-pity. Be yourself and people will naturally follow your lead. Now is an excellent time to make plans for the future. Stay grounded and on target with your goals. Make sure you aren't thrown off course by other people's whims and motivations.",
"A good tip to remember is to be careful about what you say about other people, Aries. If you're speaking about someone who isn't present, act like he or she is. What's your motivation for saying the things you say? Is it necessary to speak in such a way? A negative comment about someone is going to resonate through the cosmos. People could lose trust in you.",
"You might experience a great deal of emotional confusion, Aries. There's a debate brewing inside you, and you're having a hard time deciding whether to be practical or more fanciful. Looking to others for help may only add to the problem, so take other people's advice with a grain of salt. If nothing seems clear, wait out the storm and proceed when you have a better handle on the weather.",
"Your solid grounding may become a bit unstable today, Aries, but don't worry about it. Be a little more flexible and release your tight grip on the situation. Infuse laughter and playfulness into the picture. The exchange of ideas is critical. Get out of the house and into a social arena where you can enjoy lighthearted conversations.",
"Your focus will center on your emotions today, Aries, although being centered in itself will be quite a challenge. You may feel like a yo-yo in someone else's hand. Don't fall prey to victimization. Stand up for yourself even if it means that others get upset. You're responsible for your feelings and no one else's.",
"You may have some issues with food, Aries. Maybe your sense of self-worth isn't at its highest, and you're trying to make up for this by sabotaging your relationship with your body. Food is healthy nourishment that you need in order to survive. Your body deserves respect, and you need to give it the proper fuel it needs to be healthy.",
"Mix your reality with a bit of fantasy today, Aries. Kick back for a while and rest. Try to spend time meditating and clearing your head of daily worries. Calming, relaxing activities are the best way to spend today. Take walks with friends and go deep into conversation about outlandish subjects. Give yourself time and space to dream.",
"Your philanthropic side may want to come out and do good works today, Aries. Your default mode is to care for others. This is fine, but make sure it doesn't deplete your vital life force. The key is to offer advice and then walk away from the situation. You aren't responsible for other people's actions. Offer information, but leave the final decision up to the person you're trying to help.",
"Act on your instincts and you won't go wrong, Aries. You may need to give up control and put logical thinking aside. Let the wind take you where it will. Explore your feelings and how others influence them. It will be just about impossible to solidify any plans today. You're better off exploring options and comparing notes with others. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of thinking.",
"There's little comfort in your emotions today, Aries. You may want to stick to business. Concentrate on getting things done in your regular routine. Create a plan and stick to it. This isn't a day to deviate from the norm, nor is it a time in which you will find much sympathy from others. Stick close to home and take care of your personal business. Time is precious. Don't waste it.",
"Come out of serious mode for a day and let yourself laugh, Aries. Hold a game night at your home and invite some good friends over to play cards and nibble on snacks until all hours. This is a day to have fun, so let loose and freely express yourself in the best way you see fit. Realize how much power you have in your jovial nature. Spread it generously.",
"Technology is highlighted for you today, Aries. It could be that you install a new phone or computer system, which will make life just a bit easier. Or perhaps you decide to take a course to learn to master a technical area that has been difficult for you to grasp. Whatever you do or learn today is bound to make you happier and more productive.",
"Your self-esteem may be challenged today by a fast talker or unpleasant situation, Aries. Don't accept things at first glance. There's a much deeper meaning brewing below the surface, and you'd be foolish not to recognize that. Stick to your guns and stay grounded. Newfangled devices and big promises may not be all they're advertised to be.",
"This is no time to be a stick in the mud, Aries. Don't be the weak link in the chain. The energy of the day is \"get up and go.\" So either lead, follow, or get out of the way. There are no excuses for backing down. When opportunity knocks, you need to be ready with your bags packed. Your emotions could lead you down new and unexpected paths.",
"Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Aries. The problem with today's energy is that there just may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such airborne adversity. Powerful forces are operating with emotional aggression. War can break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace. You may need to seek shelter.",
"Social events or group activities could put you in touch with many people, Aries, both close friends and casual acquaintances. A new person may come into your life who makes a difference. Issues may come up that you feel strongly about. You aren't likely to refrain from expressing your opinions. This is fine if you're tactful. Others will appreciate your honesty.",
"You can look forward to a busy day, Aries. Don't schedule anything extra! Your home, family, or mate is likely to demand a great deal of you. In fact, your energy may be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve. If you give yourself to them completely, your nerves will be shot!",
"Try not to weigh everything down. Don't pick things apart to the point that all that's left are the tiny details of the situation, Aries. Deal with it as a whole. Mental and emotional issues are apt to be of greater concern to you. You shouldn't try to dissect them. That will only create more issues than you started with.",
"You may feel a bit short on inspiration today, Aries. Don't be discouraged! Start whatever project is in question, even if your thoughts are elsewhere. During the course of the \"bad\" work you may churn out at first, your muse gently alights on your shoulder. It sometimes takes a little discipline to lead to delicious rewards!",
"It's very possible that the best solution today is to simply give up control, Aries. When it comes to matters of the heart, other people may be in a whirl of turmoil. Trying to figure out their state of mind will be impossible so don't even try. You may just want to let things ride and see where you end up tomorrow before making any major moves.",
"The fast actions of the day may confuse you, Aries. Don't be surprised if your head is in a whirl over recent events involving love and romance. You may feel as if things are happening too quickly for you to really understand them. Try not to be so analytical. You may find that you're chasing a lost cause while the train is pulling out of the station. Hop on board and leave the other issue behind.",
"Be gentle and reserved in your approach, Aries. There's a great deal of tenderness in the air that you should tune into and enjoy. Do things to improve your home. Make amends with the people you live with and clear the air so that relations will be calm in the future. You have a great deal of yourself invested in making your home a sanctuary, so respect and nourish it.",
"Don't skimp when it comes to taking care of your physical health, Aries. In an effort to save money, you may not bother getting dental checkups, or you could opt for the least expensive doctor in the book. Nothing is more important than your health. Treat your body with the honor and respect it deserves. You may have no trouble doing for others what you know you should be doing for yourself.",
"There may be power struggles brewing beneath the surface that become evident in your interactions, Aries. Your first reaction may be to get upset and make your viewpoint even more rigid. It's important that you be more laid back. Accept that other people have different perspectives on the situation. Work with instead of against them. Walk away if others are unreasonable.",
"Try not to be a stick in the mud today, Aries. Other people aren't going to want to take the time to drag you along. Take the initiative. If you want to have fun, create it. The biggest part of this equation is your attitude. Other people can sense your jealous nature, so don't think you're fooling anyone. Let others live their lives. You need to concentrate on your own.",
"You may look at your orderly closet, well-organized desk, and clean bathroom and be proud, Aries. Other people may fret about suddenly having to get their lives in order, but you're already there. Perhaps you don't realize it because you're such a perfectionist. Perhaps you don't give yourself enough credit for all the work you do. Give yourself a pat on the back today.",
"Your mental activity is more pronounced than usual, Aries. It may be difficult to stop the barrage of thoughts streaming through your head. You may be able to accomplish a lot, but you might drive yourself crazy with the internal chatter that doesn't give you the opportunity to mentally sit still. Your thinking will be much clearer if you take time to slow down and meditate.",
"Get the rest you need, Aries. Prevent sickness and maintain full control of your mind and body by making sure you get the proper amount of sleep. Your actions today should be methodical. Don't try to experiment with something you know nothing about. Make sure you understand the situation completely before you jump in with both feet.",
"You'd do well to discipline your actions today, Aries, and keep a level head. Unexpected events may rise to challenge established authority. Don't jump to any sweeping conclusions. Make sure you gather the facts before you act. Don't simply recoil and shrink into a cave. If you don't take action, you'll be acted upon.",
"Take pride in your nurturing instincts, Aries. Rescue an injured bird or join a conservation group. Do something to help save the whales. Take a more active role in the preservation of the planet. Become a concerned citizen who regularly speaks out for what you believe in. Don't let other people's political agendas get in the way of your true purpose.",
"Today you'll have a banker's precision, Aries. You will recheck everything from your expenses to your investments to your children's pocket money, not to mention how much you've paid back on your loans. Keep at it! This is the time to do it. Despite what others think, it's important.",
"You have a generous spirit, Aries. And today you're feeling particularly altruistic. Finally, you have a chance to help your fellow man in a very real, direct way. Forget about big goals and lofty visions. Don't try to set out to eradicate world hunger. You can go down to a local shelter and help cook a meal for a few dozen people. The personal contact will do you good.",
"You may be considering taking a trip or planning a party with some friends, Aries. You may find out today that it's up to you to do all the organizing. This won't bother you too much because you know you'll do it right. Why don't you think about really trying to outdo yourself and plan something special that your friends will never forget?",
"You have exactly the right amount of discipline and sense of duty to accomplish quite a bit today, Aries. Your thinking should be clear. Your sense of time and restriction works in your favor to help you figure out any puzzles that present themselves. You have a strong will that helps you complete just about every task you undertake.",
"You feel indecisive when it comes to a romantic situation, Aries. You might ask yourself questions about how to proceed. Don't get overwhelmed by all the possibilities. Take things one step at a time. The more you read into each small gesture, the crazier you will drive yourself. Don't run around in circles. Confront the issues.",
"Some technological gadgets that you make copious use of may go out of whack today, Aries. This could prove frustrating for you, but don't vent your frustrations on them. That wouldn't help! Stay calm and call in a professional to fix the problem. Think of the expense as a contribution to your own mental health.",
"Is the stock market taking a nosedive again, Aries? Is this causing you to worry about your investments? Relax! The situation is likely temporary, and your stocks and bonds will probably regain their former value, if not surpass it. However, this isn't a good day to make new investments or even to open a bank account. Wait a few days.",
"A missed communication - or miscommunication - with a romantic partner could find you waiting in the wrong place, Aries. If you're planning to get together with someone special tonight, make sure you get the full details of the location, including the exact address, cross street, and driving directions. Write it down! And don't forget to note the time.",
"Have you been thinking about adopting a pet? Even if you haven't, a lovely little dog or cat could come into your life now and show signs of wanting to stay with you, Aries. Don't let mundane considerations get in your way. An animal could bring a lot of joy into your life now. Your health should continue to thrive, though your energy might come and go in spurts.",
"A romantic evening at home with your partner could bring the two of you closer, Aries. Your emotions are intense right now, so you need to use your intuition to judge exactly how much of your feelings you should reveal. An intellectual passion could also come your way. You might discover a new field of interest and you'll want to bury yourself at home studying it for hours.",
"A short trip might be necessary today, Aries. This could be disheartening, as it takes you away from your current love interest, but perhaps it's just as well. A phone call on this emotionally charged day might advance your relationship more than a forced evening together. Acknowledge that you're looking forward to seeing your friend again and then get on with the job!",
"A delay in completing an important project could have you feeling irritated, frustrated, and inadequate, Aries, even though you've done your best. The problem is probably beyond your control. There isn't much you can do about this but wait. There are probably a lot of other important tasks waiting. Take care of them and get your mind off the other. It'll get done eventually.",
"You may be trying to cling to something that doesn't want to sit still, Aries. It's like trying to grab a wet fish. The more tightly you squeeze it, the likelier it is to slip out of your grasp. The trick is to be more strategic and less frantic. You also might consider letting the fish go. It isn't yours anyway.",
"This should be a fortunate day, Aries, including love, career, money, and health. Plans for a trip might finally materialize, and a long-awaited solution for a niggling health concern could manifest. You should feel very enthusiastic and optimistic about your future. You might even be daring enough to take a few more chances than usual. Go for the gold, and don't be surprised if you actually get it!",
"Your mind gives you a great deal of security, Aries, which allows you to explore other worlds. You have your satellite outpost operating smoothly, and you can now take trips into the frontier knowing that you have a secure facility to fall back on. Find new ways to bring love into your life.",
"You may feel like someone's trying to pin you down before you start, Aries. Perhaps these obstacles are self-imposed. Maybe you're restricting yourself from doing the things you want to do because you're afraid they won't work out. This fear of failure is the pain you feel. Overcoming it is the first step. If you try and fail, you'll be no worse off than if you never try at all.",
"Watch out for the green-eyed monster today, Aries. It can rear up before you even say the word \"jealousy\" if you're not on your guard. Many situations that cause this feeling are born of insecurity. If you aren't secure in your job, relationship, or family, and feel threatened by someone else, it's time to take a look at the reason. Look for answers rather than lash out.",
"You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and a lie. Sometimes this can be a difficult choice, especially if you're afraid you'll hurt someone's feelings. However, a lie can take far more energy than the truth. Consider what you'd want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your ethics, even of it's tough.",
"You may put other people's needs before yours, Aries. There's an important balance between being selfish and being selfless. Don't sacrifice yourself to be a servant to others. It's important that you not think only of yourself without considering how your actions will affect others. You may swing toward the former today. This will only lead to resentment and deplete your emotional and physical resources.",
"Do you need a change of pace, Aries? If things are beginning to feel boring and you're apathetic, chances are that you do. All you have to do is figure out what to shift. If you're home most of the time, change the furniture around. It can make the house seem new. Consider putting up new pictures or bringing in fresh flowers. Switch your schedule around. This will energize you.",
"Annoying situations that arise today could have you feeling stressed, Aries. A sudden desire to escape might enter your mind. Take care not to work out your frustrations by overindulging in food or drink. This could only make the situation worse. Focus on the tasks at hand and get them done. Follow that with a long walk to clear your head and a movie to get your mind off it all.",
"Make an effort to connect with someone you miss today, Aries. Even if it feels painful at first, you'll feel a lot better once you do. Pick up the phone, write a note, or send an email. Let the person know you miss and care about him or her. Expressing yourself is often far better than stuffing your feelings. The person may be missing you just as much.",
"Today you might want to try something completely new, Aries. If you've never done this before, why not try expressing yourself through dance? Even if you're convinced you have two left feet, you might be surprised. Whatever your style, there's a type of dance you can do, whether it's as simple as the twist or as flamboyant as flamenco. You'll feel great, and it's good exercise.",
"Today family members might be less than honest with you, Aries, particularly regarding working around the house. Don't be surprised if you hear excuses! This could be irritating, but don't let it get to you. Let the chores go. Do something you enjoy. It's more fun than taking out the trash.",
"The fast-paced frenzy of the day is just what you need to jump-start your brain and get it moving in the right direction, Aries. Take control of the fire within and keep it strong all day. You'll find that there's a more personal aspect to your thoughts, and you can think more rationally about your emotions. Your heart and your head are working well together.",
"Family members might discuss a possible vacation today, Aries, but everyone wants to go to a different place! Arguments could occur, taking all the fun out of the discussion. Perhaps you should draw straws! A better solution might be to make a list of all the ideas, give copies to everyone, and think about it. Discuss the subject again in a few days.",
"An unexpected development could throw you into a tailspin, Aries. This could involve a new person in your life or the reappearance of someone from the past. This presence could incite either personal or professional changes. These could seem like a lot to handle, but could be positive over the long term. Stay calm, deal with issues one at a time, and keep your sense of humor.",
"Don't let others push you around today, Aries. People may talk themselves up, but there's little behind the words. Be careful that you don't misfire. This is a day to care about you and your needs. Take steps toward making sure you're getting what you want. Connect with people you've met recently. There's significance in these serendipitous meetings.",
"You may be the party-pooper today unless you do something to remedy your serious tone, Aries. This is a day for light, social activities and fun-loving times with friends. Don't worry if things don't seem rational. Sometimes it's the unlikeliest route that ends up being the best. Don't discount the fanciful and bizarre. Take a walk on the wild side.",
"You may have been worried about money lately, Aries. Today a family member could make an expenditure that you view as unnecessary and irresponsible. Before you become angry know that all may not be as it seems! If you look at the situation objectively, you may see that you aren't in dire financial straits and the expenditure didn't take that much out of the family coffers.",
"You'll be happiest away from prying eyes today, Aries. You're not in the mood to be friendly or participate in idle gossip. It seems you've been having the same conversations with the same people for some time now. You're feeling so bored you could scream. To avoid doing just that, spend quiet time alone today if you can.",
"There's tension in the air, Aries, but there's little you can do about it. The harsh atmosphere is in stark contrast to the frivolity you felt over the last several days. It seems you received some good news. Perhaps you were finally recognized for your hard work? Don't brag about your accomplishments. It would only exacerbate the situation. Be patient. Avoid confrontation.",
"You might do some writing today, Aries, perhaps creative or letters. Whichever it is, you might find that all that comes out are gloomy accounts of whatever's happening now. This may not reflect your true state of mind. If you can't come up with anything pleasant to write about, perhaps you'd better wait until later!",
"A strange letter or phone call could come your way today, Aries, and the information you receive could seem rather garbled. It may be good news or bad, or possibly neither, but don't accept it at face value. Somewhere along the line someone has misinterpreted some important information. If what you hear is important to you, check the facts before accepting it as truth.",
"Juicy but perhaps unkind gossip might reach you today. You may doubt the motives of a close friend. Examine any tips you receive and ascertain the true facts before you accept it as truth. Much of the information is likely to be wrong. Your imagination is flying high, so you might want to try writing or drawing.",
"Your mind is buzzing like a busy bee today, Aries. Keep things light and social. Don't get too wrapped up in details. You may tend to worry about outcomes, but the truth is that problems will work themselves out quite well if you maintain a clear view of your goals. How you get there isn't as important as where you want to go.",
"Some extra income could come your way through the use of computers or other technology, Aries. You should have a busy day, but you'll like what you do and be excited by the prospect of the extra money. Though you might not be thinking about it now, what you're doing could develop into a lucrative business, eventually bringing you to the question, what do you really want to do with your life?",
"Your inspiration and imagination are soaring today, Aries. You may want to try an artistic project of some kind. You could be pleasantly surprised at the results. Your intuition is also high, and your understanding of those around you is greatly increased. Don't be afraid to act from instinct. This is one of those days when it should win out over rationality and logic!",
"The day ahead should be excellent, Aries. You tend to work with an energy unparalleled by the other signs, and today you reap some rewards for your diligence. These days it's rare to find someone as conscientious as you, and you deserve recognition. Nevertheless, you still have many hills left to climb, as you well know!",
"You may feel the urge to get up and go today, Aries, but at the same time you may feel like you aren't prepared. Perhaps you don't feel you're on solid enough ground to take the next step. Don't let the pressure of the outside world move you to a place you aren't ready to go. Take things at your own pace, and be tolerant of those who choose to go at theirs.",
"Love and romance should be going well for you now, Aries. Something has sparked the detective in you and you're anxious to probe, inquire, and seek the truth in every situation. Your grounded, stable, and practical approach will be your greatest asset. Make sure to let someone else be the martyr today. You're the one who needs to take control.",
"Experiments combining creativity and technology could lead to opportunities to increase your income. You're receptive to new ideas and willing to make an effort to put them to work for you. You're likely to uncover new talents that you didn't know you had. This is a great day to sign up for a class, attend a lecture, or seek tutoring.",
"Romance blossoms for you today. If you're single, a walk around the neighborhood could put you in touch with someone new and exciting. If you're involved, you and your significant other could plan a trip out of town, perhaps a weekend getaway. The trip may be partly related to business. This is a great time to write, even if it's only a letter to a relative.",
"Family values that you've embraced could be challenged today. You might consider some friends to be your true family, or think that an unconventional household works better for you than a traditional one. So what if you prefer a commune to a nuclear family? Don't let the concerns of relatives cause you to hold back.",
"You can get many things accomplished today. The energy is very high intensity. Be careful about manipulating others. No one appreciates being ordered about, so be tactful. Try not to put on a show of superior knowledge. People will resent you for it even if your intentions are good (and you're right).",
"A long-awaited vacation or move you've been hoping to make could finally be possible today. Before you go, there may be some paperwork to take care of. Thoughts of business advancement may play in your mind, and you might consider taking a course or two to increase your marketability and help you get closer to achieving your goals.",
"A number of interesting visitors could come to your home today. At least one could be from a foreign country, and some could be in the educational field. You can expect some interesting conversations, and you might learn some fascinating facts on a subject that's new to you. You could enjoy learning this so much that you look for books on the subject tomorrow.",
"Light a candle and make a wish. See the flame as a symbol of the transformation and passion within you. Your heart may feel restless. The flame flutters as a result of the passing wind. As the flame dances, you may remember the dances that you perform in an attempt to draw attention away from an issue that you know you must face. The time is now.",
"Add a bit of spice in your life by engaging in spontaneous activities. It's time to get out and enjoy more of the world. Explore those things that are inherently different from what you'd expect to find. Pick the closed door instead of the open one through which you can see to the other side.",
"Something may get your dander up today. There are hot tempers and strong opinions right and left. Try to see the big picture. You'll seek extra attention from others, especially when it comes to your needs and emotions. People will be irritable, but arguing will only make the situation worse. Give everyone some time and you'll find that many issues work themselves out.",
"Equipment you've come to depend on in your daily life might suddenly go down today. This might throw you into a panic, but don't fall into this trap. Phone a friend who knows about these things or bring in a professional. At times like this, it's best not to agonize over a malfunction but to just get it taken care of as quickly as possible.",
"There's a great deal of transforming energy in the air that you should harness and capitalize on. You may be a fan of the diet that you'll start \"tomorrow.\" When tomorrow comes and there's a huge meal of pizza, soda, and fries, suddenly the diet once again starts \"tomorrow.\" Use the powerful energy of today to break out of this habit and make a real change in your life.",
"All should be going well for you - love, money, and career. Still, you seek other goals, and today you might be thinking of educational, intellectual, and spiritual matters that you've always wanted to pursue. Don't be surprised if you're preoccupied with trying to sort it all out. And don't feel you have to rush to make a decision. Give it some time.",
"You may be going through tremendous growth now. Focus on this and see where you need to make some changes. This may be interrupted by powerful energy from other people or situations. These issues are important. They're alerting you to certain changes that may be overdue. Look at how this upheaval can bring about growth and success. Opportunities await.",
"Have you been thinking about moving? Perhaps you've even bought a new home. Whatever your situation, you may execute some paperwork today, perhaps an agreement with a realtor or contractor, or maybe escrow papers. This could be frustrating, as the wording of the documents might seem obscure. Get it out of the way. You won't regret it!",
"Family members might have too much on their minds today and ask you for more help than you're prepared to give. Make sure you stay calm and focused so you can decide which difficulties are most urgent and need to be handled first. Don't be afraid to tell others your decision. When possible, give advice rather than help. Sometimes that's all people really need.",
"This may be one of those days in which you don't feel like doing anything and you can't force yourself. While you're out you'll shop just enough to take care of essentials, and at home you'll probably veg out in front of the TV. Don't feel any guilt over it. We all need days like this. Take it easy, relax, and you'll be your old self again tomorrow.",
"You're apt to feel rather tense today and blame it on boredom and discontent with your current life. You could spend much of the morning daydreaming, formulating outrageous plans to escape what you see as a rut. While doing this you might discover an idea that's not only appealing but also workable. Consider it carefully over the next few days. You might want to go for it!",
"Today may be taken up with doing a lot of last-minute errands. You may be called on to referee a dispute among colleagues, relatives, or neighbors. Depending on the nature of the spat, you may be able to broker a temporary truce, but don't be too hard on yourself if tempers simmer despite your best efforts. Try and make relaxation a priority.",
"Your energy level is at an all-time high, so you may work harder than usual. You could be inspired to work around the house, cleaning, repairing, and straightening up. Visitors may drop by unexpectedly this evening. Even though you weren't planning on having company for dinner, the house is in good shape and you play the host beautifully.",
"Someone you love dearly could provide inspiration for creative activity of some kind. You might write a song or poem about your friend, draw or paint a portrait, or cook a special meal. Don't hesitate out of shyness or embarrassment. Your friend will be touched. Your efforts will be appreciated and contribute a great deal to the permanence of your friendship.",
"Trips will likely be mired in mechanical difficulties and delays of all types. You'll get to your destination eventually, but you're going to have to be patient. If you're heading to the airport, be sure to bring a book - a long one - to make the wait more bearable. If you're just heading across town, bring along your favorite music to keep your spirits up.",
"This is a good day for meditation. You've probably been trying to distract yourself from unresolved issues through shopping or eating. Try taking some time today to think about what's really bothering you. It would do you some good to get outside and connect with nature. Try taking a long walk in a park.
