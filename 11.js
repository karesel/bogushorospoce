exports.arr = ["There's a stronger connectedness to dreams and fantasies today, Aquarius, but you may need to adjust your thinking in order to link to it. Pick a path that includes a few steps on the sunny side of the street where you can see things in a positive light instead of focusing on the gloom in every situation. Communicate your thoughts and think about how you can promote peace in your inner circle.",
"You may feel a bit of a strain today as you try to figure out the best way to get to where you need to be, Aquarius. The happy, jovial approach tells you to let loose, be courageous, and strike out with conviction toward the things that mean the most to you. A sense of duty and restriction may be holding you back. Take the best of both worlds and come up with a unique plan of attack.",
"Your fantasy world is especially piqued today, Aquarius. Your need to escape physical reality is strong. Be careful about how you go about this. Dreams may take you there, but be rational so you aren't left more confused than before. Keep your energy pure and clean. Other people will recognize you for your tender, sensitive nature, so feel free to be confident with your words.",
"You're going through a time in which you have the opportunity to make tremendous advances, Aquarius. These rewards won't come without hard work and discipline, however, and this seems to be a focus of the day. Get your emotions in line and make the best of what seems to be a pretty dreary situation. A fantastic opportunity is at hand.",
"Today's energies will get progressively more intense as the day goes on. In the morning, you may be in an easygoing, dreamy state, Aquarius, but you will be itching to take action by nightfall. Take what you've learned from your sensitive, meditative state and share it with others. Use your inner calm to bring stability to stressful situations. Make sure things don't get out of hand tonight.",
"Close relationships could lead to a feeling of spiritual unity today. In fact, Aquarius, you might feel as if those who share your interests are actually your family now. If you're involved, expect to experience warm and passionate feelings toward your partner. If not, don't be surprised if someone new comes on the scene. Shared intellectual interests might be what bring you together.",
"Have you taken someone for granted lately? Today you should give them the thanks and attention they deserve, Aquarius. Your sensitivity and psychic awareness are especially strong. You aren't in the mood to put up with superficialities. Stick with what is real and say it like it is. Tension in your daily life may surface, but if you have things under control, you will ride through it just fine.",
"All your relationships should be especially warm and supportive now, Aquarius. This is a great day to form a business, personal, or romantic partnership.

You might find that others share your thoughts.",
"You might not be able to accomplish what you'd hoped today, Aquarius. Some minor but irritating conflicts could occur within a group. You might find this exasperating, as petty squabbles interfere with reaching the group's objectives. You could be called on to use your intuition and sensitivity to spread oil on troubled waters. Be direct, fair, and clear, and try not to let your irritation show.",
"Doubts about a friend's motives could plague you today, Aquarius. This person seems to be acting strangely and isn't communicating. This probably has little if anything to do with you. This person has issues that he or she is having trouble with. There are others who are in a better space whose company you will enjoy at this time. Get together and enjoy the amiable atmosphere.",
"You may wonder if you're losing your memory today. You might have the strange feeling that there was something you had to do but can't quite remember what. Don't worry about it, Aquarius. If you push yourself too hard, you will drive yourself crazy. Your imagination could come up with ideas for stories and poems. Write them down. You will want to remember them.",
"Unexpected economic developments might make a sudden and positive difference in your situation, Aquarius. Perhaps your field becomes more competitive, and people with your skills are more in demand. Whatever it is, you can expect more money to come your way in the future. Legal papers could be involved, as could some interesting people you haven't met before. Your mind is likely to be buzzing.",
"Today you may spend some time by yourself working on your own projects, Aquarius. The desire to spend time alone with a special someone may also interfere with plans you've already made to attend a social gathering or event involving a lot of people. You won't want to give up either, so you might try to find a compromise of some kind. Think about it.",
"Information that you receive from far away could make doing business with a group you're affiliated with that much easier, Aquarius. All looks promising for group activities and advancing your education, so these are good focuses for today. Travel might also be on your mind. Friends could be inclined to consider the idea, so it might be fun to go out on the town with them tonight.",
"Intellect combines with intuition to produce a particularly enlightening day on all subjects, Aquarius, whether they're intellectual, practical, or metaphysical.

You might want to explore this possibility.",
"A copious amount of physical and mental energy could focus on psychic, metaphysical, or spiritual activities today, Aquarius. You're feeling especially intuitive. You could almost read minds.

You might also want to write down your ideas on whatever subject interests you most.",
"Today you might see old and new friendships and romantic involvements reach a new understanding, Aquarius. This creates a stronger commitment between you and those who care for you. This is a great day to execute paperwork, particularly legal contracts. Your business sense is operating at a very high level. You're more apt to spot clauses that need work, so go for it today.",
"Some changes regarding your career could make a difference in your resources. This could involve a pending raise or promotion or opportunities for freelance work outside the job. It might imply a new job, perhaps in a creative field. Whatever work you do is likely to seem more emotionally rewarding than it has been, Aquarius. This should boost your spirits considerably.",
"There may be a rather confusing element to the day, Aquarius. You feel tempted to act, but some of the pieces seem to be missing. It could be hard to make a decision, since you don't have the whole picture in front of you. You're better off spending this day outside with a group of friends rather than trying to make any major life decisions or commitments.",
"Your intuitive abilities are flying high, Aquarius. Normally you're sensitive, but today you might be picking up on the thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires of strangers who pass in the street. If you turn this ability to those around you, you're likely to be able to use it to increase your understanding of them, and thus bring you closer together. Don't let this opportunity pass you by.",
"A woman you meet at work might point you in a new direction, Aquarius. You should investigate all possible options. This could be a new intellectual interest, a technological skill, or possibly a new and more lucrative source of income. It may involve an unusual field, but don't worry about that. The world is changing, so what seems unorthodox now could be commonplace tomorrow.",
"Finances are highlighted for you today, Aquarius. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing - it just is. Spend as much time as necessary sorting out your records and making sure everything is in good order. It's never too early to collect receipts and get organized. You may feel inspired to concentrate on budgeting as well.",
"Is a bit of redecorating in order? This is a perfect time to spruce up your home. Rather than rush into a project that you might later regret, Aquarius, it's better to spend the day with color and fabric swatches. Once you're happy with a scheme, then you can pick up a paintbrush. Think hard before making a decision.",
"The day will be fairly eventful, Aquarius. There's some likelihood that you will feel suddenly compelled to settle a tedious matter once and for all. It may concern something in your domestic life that's been left unattended. You won't rest until it's finished, and you won't be distracted, no matter how you're cajoled to join the others. This problem is the only thing that will matter today.",
"Stress due to overwork might be causing your energy to flag somewhat today, Aquarius. You might even feel a little under the weather. This is a great day to stay home and recover. Stay out of stressful situations and do things on your own, preferably routine tasks that you can do without thinking. In the evening, order a pizza and watch TV. Don't make more work for yourself by cooking.",
"Information received through dreams and visions could trigger sudden psychic revelations of solutions to problems you may have been mulling over for weeks. What you realize is likely to clear up any difficulties and pave the way for success. The emotional release could have you feeling like a heavy weight has been lifted off your shoulders. Obey your impulses, and get to it.",
"An upsetting dream about someone you love deeply could cause you to awaken suddenly in the night, Aquarius. You might have to ground yourself a little in reality before trying to go back to sleep. Stay calm. The dream isn't prophetic. It probably relates to your own fears about this person, or maybe even about yourself. Wait until morning and write down the dream. The meaning should clarify by then.",
"Today you could experience a strong desire to clear your psyche of past traumas that limit you, Aquarius. You may decide to register for a seminar or workshop of some kind.

Go for it, and have fun.",
"The company of good friends, perhaps at a group activity or festival of some kind, contributes to a powerful feeling of good health, good fortune, and happiness, Aquarius.

There will be a few minor accidents - dropping things, spilling drinks - but in all, this should be a satisfying day.",
"A burst of physical energy might have you spending hours working out today, Aquarius. You might decide to try a new and ambitious exercise program. Take care not to push yourself past your limits. A heightened sense of adventure combines with a powerful desire to be fit, and it might drive you to exhaustion if you aren't careful. You have to learn to crawl before you learn to walk.",
"Expect to be frantic if you have to take care of something that's time critical today, Aquarius. People and situations aren't in your favor. Everything will seem like a challenge.

"Some letters and calls that you may have agreed to do for a group you're affiliated with might have to be taken care of today, Aquarius.

Your determination is strong.",
"Learning comes easily to you, Aquarius, as your mind is especially sharp and retentive. Your intuition is usually high, but today it's especially acute, as is your concentration. Therefore, this is a great day to read or work on an art project. Set aside some time alone to contemplate. It may help you on a very deep level.",
"Your writing, speaking, and communicating skills are enhanced today, Aquarius. Therefore, you can expect to impress a lot of people around you who will change their opinion about you. People will express their sympathy openly, and you will feel integrated and accepted throughout the day. Tonight, find a bookstore that's sponsoring a lecture and go.",
"No matter what friends tell you, Aquarius, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.",
"You should feel especially sociable today, Aquarius. You might attend one or more events, or perhaps you will choose another type of group activity. Relationships of all kinds should prove satisfying and comforting. Expect to grow closer to the friends you have and meet new friends with whom you share many interests. You continue to meet professional, creative, and financial goals in a big way.",
"Your physical energy is likely to be very high today, and you might want to spend most of your time out and about, probably in the company of others. You may attend a concert this evening or some other kind of entertainment that you really enjoy. There might be a slight delay in getting there, Aquarius, but don't panic. You should arrive eventually.",
"This is an intense phase of interior modification, both physically and psychologically. Don't hesitate to padlock your refrigerator and avoid your favorite stores, Aquarius. You need to exert a bit more self-control as far as eating or spending is concerned if you want to get back into shape physically and mentally. Have you been overdoing it a little lately? Perhaps you regret it now.",
"When you were younger, your humanity and generosity seemed limitless. You felt very involved in the world and what was going wrong with it. Today you may remember these great dreams. It may be time to make some of those dreams come true. It would be especially beneficial to you if you could somehow connect this to the work you do for a living. It's never too late to make a dream come true.",
"You're entering a positive period of calm and vitality, Aquarius. There's a harmonic atmosphere. You feel very close to the people you love, and they will show you just how much they care about you. Don't try and understand the unexpected nature of the wonderful vibe around you. Just live life to the fullest today. Good things don't always last forever",
"To friends and colleagues, you may seem to have suddenly acquired acute business sense. Your experience has joined with knowledge acquired from others to enable you to formulate practical ideas for advancement. You may have lost faith in your goals, but now they seem more attainable. What you've wanted for a while could be within your grasp. You could make some real progress.",
"Creative projects that you may have been working on for a while could prove especially ego boosting, Aquarius. You're doing a great job. A change of employment and increase in income may be in the works. If you don't feel passionate about what you're doing, expect the chance to become involved in an enterprise that you do feel strongly about. New ideas and opportunities could change your life.",
"You may feel a bit lonely today, Aquarius, even if there are people all around you. It may seem like everyone's on a different plane. Maybe you think you have nothing in common with others - even those you generally feel closest to. You may be apprehensive about what they think of you after you tell them what you're really thinking or feeling. Don't let this stop you from making your thoughts known.",
"Stick with what comes naturally, Aquarius. If something feels difficult or abrasive, this is a sign that your energy is better used elsewhere. But don't turn away until you're sure that what you're facing is actually a combative force instead of your own skewed sense of reality. You could be overly sensitive about a given situation and thereby making up scenarios that don't even exist.",
"You're likely to be in a good space right now, Aquarius. If you're single, you're in no hurry to change that. If you're involved, you and your partner should be getting along very well. However, you might experience a little doubt when a current or potential partner becomes uncommunicative. Your friend probably has money worries. Let him or her know you're there to listen, then back off.",
"Your connection with others is especially strong today, Aquarius. You will enjoy an important nurturing role. Reconnect with your mother and let her know how you're feeling. Curl up with loved ones tonight and surprise someone with a romantic gesture. Try something unconventional. Your feelings may be strong and erratic. You may be feel like pulling back into your protective shell. If so, do it.",
"If you haven't been feeling like yourself lately, Aquarius, a surge of inner power could push you over the top and make you feel strong and healthy again. You could decide to complete all your unfinished tasks today. You could get most of them done by day's end. Don't forget to take time out to enjoy yourself. You want to make the most of your newfound strength.",
"Someone, perhaps a person involved with a group you're in, may ask you to help in some way today. You probably don't want to do it, Aquarius, possibly because you have plans. Don't be afraid to say no. Your creative energy should be high and your imagination working overtime, but other responsibilities interfere with your doing anything about it now. Note your ideas and come back to them later.",
"Nervous tension could cause a temporary malaise that keeps your energy low today. Tasks and chores need to be done, Aquarius, so you will probably drag yourself up and try to finish them in spite of the way you feel. Try not to get overworked, and try not to take your weariness out on others. It's better to let work go than make yourself and everyone else more stressed out.",
"Happy events involving your mother or another close female relative might have you feeling emotional, Aquarius. It could involve a marriage or birth. Your own projects, particularly those done with other people, could be going well in spite of having to overcome some difficulties. The results could move you to tears, and you may feel the need to control yourself. Don't be afraid to show how you feel.",
"Today's a good day to ground your fluctuating emotions, Aquarius. Step back from the drama you create and evaluate your inner state. Are you fooling yourself into thinking everything's OK when it really isn't? Be honest with your highest truths and ground yourself back in reality. Write down your thoughts.",
"A complex creative project could require some in-depth research today, Aquarius, and you could spend much of the day online or in the library. This is probably a subject you love, so you won't mind the time you put in. The inspiration that comes your way could well last for a while. You might be able to treat this project as a business enterprise and give it more substance.",
"Happy memories of a beloved grandparent may float to the surface today, Aquarius, and you may wonder why. Something or someone you've encountered in the past few days may have reminded you of this person. It's nice and it isn't an accident. What personality trait of yours does your grandparent call to mind? A psycho-emotional issue associated with this trait may need to be resolved now.",
"You may need to deal with someone's disapproval today, Aquarius. This will likely come from someone you see as either a superior or authority figure, perhaps a parent. While it's important to listen to this person, if what they say involves your job, personal life, or how you choose to live, it's no one's concern but yours. No matter how you do things, someone will disapprove somewhere.",
"You may want to learn about something today, Aquarius. At work and home there's a set schedule of what you must tend to and when. On your own time, you're free to research anything your heart desires. Intellectual growth is something you enjoy, so why not spend time online or in the library finding out more about your favorite things? Whether cooking or genealogy, you will find something new.",
"Today you may emphasize organizing things and managing your life, Aquarius. Take a look at your time management.

There are many books and websites out there on this subject. Check them out.",
"You may feel a real need to get moving today, Aquarius. Almost everyone prefers quiet activities, books, art, and even just sitting around to physical activity at times.

Chances are you will really enjoy yourself.",
"Find some new ways to expand your horizons, Aquarius. The web has an infinite amount of information to explore, and your community and local colleges offer many courses from which to choose. Think about what you'd enjoy learning. Perhaps a new skill for your job or a crafts class that shows you how to make things. Whether self-defense or Italian strikes your fancy, it's out there. Find it.",
"Expect an added boost to your physical energy today, Aquarius. It's an excellent day to clean out closets and storage rooms. Some exercise like biking or walking will be most enjoyable. It may also prove to be well worth your while to sit down and look at your goals. Are you where you wanted to be at this stage of your life? Are there changes that need to be made? Exercise both your brain and body.",
"You might want to check your alarm clock to be sure it really woke you up this morning. Your tendency today will be to stay in the cocoon of your little dream world, deep in your own thoughts. Obsessive thoughts, in particular, will try and drown out some more pressing issues from the past that need resolution once and for all. Ring! It's time to wake up!",
"When it comes to managing money today, Aquarius, you should go with your gut, whether it involves personal finances, job-related concerns, or the funds of a group you're affiliated with. Be less concerned about logic and more with how you feel about sources of income, specific investments, or ways of planning expenses. Do some research to verify your insights and then follow them!",
"You might find it necessary to give yourself a bit of self-healing, Aquarius. Other people may want your attention, looking for advice and help with their own sob stories, when in reality you have your own matters to take care of. Attend to these today. Be a bit selfish if you have to. Make sure you attend to your own needs.",
"Try to get more grounded in your actions regarding love and romance, Aquarius. You may need to take a more reserved approach in your actions in order to get where you need to go.

"An opportunity to earn extra money in a creative way may come today from an unexpected and perhaps even previously unknown source, Aquarius.

Someone who owes you money might suddenly pay you back. This should definitely be a good day for money!",
"Today you might want to host a meeting of your metaphysically inclined friends, Aquarius. Discussions could lead to insights that none of you would have come up with alone. Your minds will be going a thousand miles an hour. None of you may ever be the same! Don't forget to take notes of your discussions. You won't want to forget a thing you've heard or said.",
"If you've been feeling under the weather, expect to feel stronger today than you were before, Aquarius. Your enthusiasm is up and new ideas are flowing into your brain. Whatever you work on today should really stand out. You will experience a new sense of power and optimism. Don't be too intense, though. Others might get the wrong impression. Be your usual sensitive self and all will be fine.",
"Your self-esteem should be good now, Aquarius. You will find that you can make great strides on long-term projects. This is a good day to put your nose to the grindstone and get to work.

All signs are that your friend has received some bad news and didn't want to upset you. Hang in there. You should hear from your honey again soon.",
"Information gleaned today might not be totally accurate, Aquarius. Someone may be repeating gossip or making stories up out of whole cloth.

Your workload might be especially heavy and you might have a deadline, so you have a ready excuse not to pay any attention!",
"You're feeling extremely romantic and passionate today, Aquarius. If you've experienced a rift with your spouse or loved one, this would be the day to make amends. Why not make reservations at an intimate restaurant? A night out may be just what you need to rekindle that spark. You surely have enough passion to whip the spark into an enduring flame.",
"Have you been feeling psychic lately, Aquarius? Has a recent dream or premonition come true? Any insights that you receive today aren't likely to be clothed in complex symbolism - they should be easily understood. Write them down! You will want to check them later. Some of what you sense might be a little disturbing, perhaps involving a public figure you admire. Be prepared!",
"The aura today is calm and peaceful, stress is at a minimum. You're likely to be getting along very well with your group, even the more difficult among them. As a result, you will probably accomplish a lot more together than usual. At the end of the day you will be pleased with what you've done and proud of yourself. Go to it!",

You're physically fit, you look great, and you will be happy to spend the day socializing.",
"A study of a philosophical or metaphysical concept or perhaps an ancient or foreign culture could take up a lot of your time today, Aquarius. Your mind is especially sharp and penetrating now, so you should notice more, learn more quickly, and retain more of what you read. The only downsides are possible eyestrain and a buzzing mind. Take a walk before you go to bed.",
"A change in your working circumstances could make a positive difference to you, Aquarius. Perhaps you've moved to another desk, room, floor, or building. Whichever it is, you will be less stressed out. Being near difficult people or sitting near a window where you can see out can recharge your batteries and make you more productive.",
"The survival of a partnership could depend on some open and honest communication today, Aquarius. Conflicting issues may be simmering and need to be aired in a sensitive and caring way. It's vital to express the affection you feel for your partner and the importance of this partnership to you. The conversation may not be an easy one, but you will feel better for it by day's end.",
"Today, Aquarius, you're likely to undertake some seemingly urgent decorating projects in order to get your home in tip-top shape. It could be that a few minor purchases are all that's needed. But you may decide you can't live with the color of the bedroom one moment longer and take matters into your own hands and do the job yourself. You will be exhausted but pleased by the end of the day.",
"This isn't the day for contracts or legal work of any kind, Aquarius. You may think you understand everything about a document, but it's likely you don't. The atmosphere is ripe for misinformation and misunderstanding. You will be well served today if you keep to yourself and do your work carefully and systematically. The legal documents can wait for another day.",
"Better communication should pave the way for personal and professional advancement, Aquarius. You might come to a new understanding with colleagues or you could get some state-of-the-art equipment that enables operations to run more smoothly. Romantic relationships improve, perhaps because of increased communication. Your intuition can give you an edge when dealing with others.",
"Rewards from hard work and dedication could finally be in the offing, Aquarius. You experience the warm feeling that comes from deep satisfaction and knowing that you deserve everything wonderful that's happening. You will want to bask in your happiness with your loved ones. Plan a celebration and share your good fortune with the people who have supported you.",
"Much of today will be a continuation of yesterday, but with perhaps a bit more intensity for you, Aquarius. There's an added buzz in the air, like static on a radio. This background noise may not provide the best environment to work in, but you should be able to navigate with no problem. Tune out the chatter and move on.",
"There's an explosive quality about the day. You may walk along, minding your own business, when someone accidentally bumps into you. Your first reaction may be to push that person back. Carelessness on the part of others may cause you to get worked up into fits of rage. Do your best to keep these tendencies under control, especially when driving.",
"Confusion about money might be on your mind today, Aquarius. This doesn't necessarily mean that your finances are in chaos. Chances are that you face unfamiliar options concerning your financial future, and so you may be in no position to make any kind of decision. Don't feel that you have to do it today. It would be best if you waited a few days until you're a bit more focused to consider your options.",
"Expect to spend much of your day alone, Aquarius. Information obtained from books or videos, perhaps involving history, philosophy, or religion, might inspire you to look deeper into a subject and turn it to your own advantage. You might decide to take a trip or return to college. There's also the chance that you could be inspired to write or otherwise express your ideas and feelings. Go to it!",
"Your moods are always fluctuating. Today looks like you're on an up note, Aquarius, so enjoy the caring, sensitive mood of the day. You should find that you can clearly express your emotions on a more intellectual level. At the same time, you're also able to put more feeling and sensitivity in your otherwise dry intellect. Realize that we are all one.",
"You may not be having the best of luck when it comes to matters of the heart, Aquarius, and you may feel you need to take some sort of action. Be careful of acting just for the sake of creating movement. Perhaps the best policy for you now is to relax where you are and wait for the perfect love to come to you. Your battery will be well charged when the time comes to use it.",
"You may sense that the actions around you are fueled by selfish motives. You may be the only one who really sees what's going on, Aquarius. You feel like an observer on a mountain looking down with disdain on the people below. You understand the politics of the situation, yet from your high vista you feel powerless to implement effective change. Collect data now and act later.",
"A sudden burst of physical energy and determination could lead to additional income for you, Aquarius. This is probably due to an unexpected opportunity to do some extra work outside the scope of your usual employment. It could also be a long overdue payment for past work. You could also receive acknowledgement of some kind for work well done, further firing your enthusiasm. Go for the gold!",
"Don't be afraid of the fire today, Aquarius. Instead, embrace it and incorporate more of it into your life. Certain people may intimidate you at first, but that doesn't mean you should run away from the scene. More than likely this feeling of intimidation is a signal that there's something you need to learn from that person or situation. Stick around and pay attention.",
"Bring more of your feelings into the open today, Aquarius. Don't be so paranoid about what other people think. At times you may feel as if you're in some sort of spy movie with you playing the lead role. The people around you are other players in the game, and you may feel that sometimes they can't be trusted. Maybe they're working for the enemy. It's time to dismiss these thoughts from your mind.",
"A friend might approach you with the idea of forming a partnership, and even propose drawing up a tentative agreement. This is definitely something worth looking into, Aquarius, although you should consider all the facts before committing. Success and good fortune are definitely in the works, whether through this partnership or not. Expect an important call from a romantic partner.",
"You're apt to be in a good mood today, Aquarius. The roller coaster of feelings you've been on is finally coming to a stable platform. Get off the ride and enjoy the comfort of solid ground. Take a walk and treat yourself to something you enjoy - ice cream or a new book. Deal with practical issues instead of getting lost in your imagination. You will sleep more soundly tonight if you do.",
"Other people may find it difficult to deal with today's intensity, Aquarius, but you will be quite adept at fitting into whatever situation comes your way. The waters may get quite rough, especially when it comes to love and romance, but know that the boat you're on is seaworthy. There's also room for others, so let more people on board.",
"Increased communication between you and those around you, particularly the partner in your life, brings a new understanding between you. Your head and heart seem to be in better accord, so you're feeling especially optimistic right now. This optimism isn't just related to career and financial matters but to private matters, especially your romantic life, too.",
"You may feel a tendency to do things the same old way today simply because it's what feels most comfortable, Aquarius. Even though the familiar route may be tempting now, it's actually better if you seek a different way to go. Things may feel chaotic, especially in the morning and early afternoon. Still, don't automatically resist things that are new and different.",
"Reach out to those people you know will make you feel better today, Aquarius. There's no reason to sit in your room alone and depressed when you know there are people who would love to hear from you. Don't think that others are too busy to listen to your thoughts and feelings. Your emotions are strong, and your incredibly sensitive mind can offer a great deal of insight.",
"You may fall into a bottomless pit today, Aquarius. Be careful about offering so much of yourself that you drain your internal resources. You might think other people will be equally generous about offering themselves to you. Don't assume this. You're better off assuming that you will get nothing in return. Play your cards from this standpoint and you may be a bit more conservative.",
"The possibility of moving out of your neighborhood may have occurred to you before, Aquarius, but events today might have you finally making up your mind to do it. Perhaps too many good neighbors have moved away, or maybe some good fortune has made it possible for you to move to a bigger place. There is much to consider and decide before it happens, but if this is what you really want, go for it.",
"Unexpected social invitations might find you meeting people in the healing professions - doctors, surgeons, nurses, or technicians. You might also rub shoulders with bankers and investment advisers. Take their contact information. They may prove valuable to you later. Financially beneficial news of some kind could come today. This is a good time to invest or start a new savings plan.",
"Over the past few months you may have thrown yourself into your work, accomplishing feats that ordinary people would never even try. Today you should give your brain a day off! Don't worry. Your successes haven't gone unnoticed by higher-ups, and you can expect to reap the rewards that come with hard work. For now, you need to do something light and entertaining to recharge those batteries.",
"This is a good day to spend with your family, Aquarius, as you love to do. Try to get chores out of the way as quickly as possible and schedule something fun for the afternoon. Maybe you would enjoy an outing to a park or movie. Perhaps it would be fun to bake cookies. Whatever you decide, warmth and love will permeate the air and bring you closer together as you create wonderful memories.",
"A few extra things need to be done around the house today, Aquarius. A few more letters need to be written, a few more cleaning chores should be done, and you might still want to dress the place up a little. Your mood is very positive, and you should speed through these tasks with little energy drain. You will have plenty left for socializing tonight.",
"Today indicates that you can expect to make a leap in your career, Aquarius. Your intellect and communicative skills have served you well in the past months, paving the way for advancement. You may decide to try hard to be sure the promotion occurs. You might work extra hours and decide to commit to some new projects so the higher-ups can see how eager you are.",
"You're likely changing your mind about something that has been important to you, Aquarius. Perhaps you're questioning your job, career path, or choice of a mate. Confusion may dominate your thoughts today. Don't expect to arrive at any concrete answers by day's end. This is a situation that will only be resolved with time. Try to be patient.",
"You might feel lonely and insecure due to lack of contact with a close friend or romantic partner, Aquarius. You might wonder if the person has forgotten you or simply doesn't care anymore. Take the time to try to connect with this person. You may discover that no neglect was intended and that the relationship is solid. It's better for you to tackle this directly rather than speculate.",
"Success and good fortune are strongly indicated today, Aquarius, along with a sense of optimism. All sorts of changes and surprises lie in store for you. You may receive information from a business partner that radically changes your short-term plans. A trip may be in order, or you could have a visitor. You accept the change in plans with your usual good humor. You're a winner!",
"Your intuition may guide you in a direction that seems at odds with what logic and practicality tell you, Aquarius. This could put you in a quandary. Should you try to be practical or should you follow your heart? Don't make the decision today. Ask friends for advice if you like, but wait a few days before making any irrevocable choice. The uncertainty should clear up before long.",
"If you're attending a class tonight, do something frivolous for the rest of the day. Read romance novels instead of great literature. Otherwise, by the time you get to class you will already be suffering from intellectual overload and absorb very little of what you hear. Keep yourself hungry for knowledge until you get there. That way you will learn quickly and retain a lot.",
"Your emotions may be erratic, Aquarius. You may want everyone to know what you're feeling and act out in an immature manner to get noticed. In a way, you feel like a kid who will do anything to get a parent's attention, even if the action is naughty. At the same time, you don't want to be seen as the bad kid. As a result, you may just mope until someone asks you what's wrong.",
"Today is a great day to make your big move, Aquarius. If there's something in the love and romance department that you feel you need to act on, this is the day to do it. It's now or never. Approach all situations in a practical, caring manner. Plow forward with confidence and don't look back. Indulge in those things that give you pleasure. Get a massage or take a bubble bath tonight.",
"Your love, generosity, and sense of beauty are heightened today, Aquarius. If there's one thing you need to do, it's go outside and watch the sunset. The romantic, creative, and beautiful side of all things, including you, will resonate strongly and create a lasting bond with your inner core. Your sense of self will be restored through tender moments and sensual experiences.",
"Use your powerful sense of intuition today, Aquarius. Whether you realize it consciously or not, the oceans are creating a tsunami of power that won't be ignored. Make sure you're operating from a solid base before you extend yourself outward. Be careful of the rip tides. It may be fun to play in the waves, but this is one of those times in which you could easily get sucked out to sea.",
"Communications coming your way today may be more plentiful than useful, Aquarius. You could receive lots of confusing phone calls. At first you will be excited by the mailbox full of letters, but then you'll find that some are junk while others are addressed to people you've never heard of. Hang in there. This tendency should pass by tomorrow!",
"Sometimes friends become a person's real family. Your friendships are deep and enduring. Many people are eager to give you help today, so why are you reluctant to receive it? Haven't you been the one promoting the benefits of warm, sincere friendship? The day ahead makes you aware of your talents and reinforces just how important such friendships really are.",
"Your goal for the day seems to be to enchant your mate. There's no reason not to try. Indeed, today is excellent for love. But don't exaggerate your romantic wiles, Aquarius. Since the day's aspects tend to distort your perception of things, you may be betrayed by what you see in the mirror. Be careful of what you do and how you do it!",
"Today you might decide to host a social event in your home, perhaps for friends and colleagues with whom you share intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual interests. Dreams, astrology, or metaphysics could come up. This should be a congenial gathering. You're apt to bond closely with these people. At least one of them might be a potential romantic partner who finds you fascinating.",
"Today you should feel especially sensual, Aquarius. You will want to bask in the pleasure of being in love. A passionate encounter could occur at your home, probably after a wonderful meal you've prepared. You could have a frank discussion about the future of the relationship. You might decide to try living together if you don't already. Think carefully about it and do what feels right.",
"Premonitions today might be rather disturbing, Aquarius, and you might actually feel some fear because of them. Don't panic! Your intuitive abilities aren't quite as sharp as usual. What you feel could be distorted or untrue. This doesn't mean you've lost it, either. Try to be objective about everything you pick up psychically. You will be glad you did.",
"Pay attention to your dreams today, Aquarius. They're likely to be interesting! If possible, write down your impressions the moment you wake up. They may not mean much at first, but after a few days you can review your notes and you may be surprised by what they reveal. You're in the mood for a major change in your life, and your dreams may point you in the right direction.",
"Today could be filled with delays and mix-ups at the office, Aquarius. You'd be well advised to remain as patient as possible. Take deep breaths and maintain your sense of humor. Most of what occurs today is outside your control. You may as well go with the flow and see where the day leads you. Make a point to relax with loved ones tonight.",
"A strange, bothersome feeling could plague you today, Aquarius, as if you can't remember something you need to do. Don't drive yourself crazy over this. Chances are you haven't forgotten anything but had a rather irritating dream. If you can't seem to shake the idea, try asking your subconscious to pull up the dream. Write it down. Once you know what it's all about, you will probably feel free again.",
"Start today on the right foot by projecting a positive mood and healthy mindset, Aquarius. If you're dragging your heels and already dreading the forthcoming events, you will only succeed in making it harder to move ahead, regardless of what you end up doing. Attitude is everything. This is one of those days in which it matters the most.",
"Material values may pale beside spiritual ones today, Aquarius. You might consider giving up the rat race and retreating to the wilderness. This would perhaps make a good vacation, but you probably aren't ready to chuck it all just yet. Don't be too hard on yourself if your enjoyment of worldly pleasures returns tomorrow. Changes like this come gradually, not overnight. Take it at your own pace.",
"Financial paperwork might have you baffled today, Aquarius. You might not be in the right frame of mind to do it now, so if it isn't urgent, wait a day or two. If you need to take care of it immediately, don't be too shy about consulting someone else. You will be glad you did, and you won't have to wonder whether or not you did it right.",
"Have you been walking or exercising too much lately, Aquarius? If so, you might experience aching feet and legs today. Wear comfortable shoes and stay off your feet as much as you can in order to allow the pains to heal. You might want to relax in a hot tub at some point, preferably with a romantic partner! This is one way to turn a misfortune into a great time.",
"It looks like your ship is about to come in, Aquarius. The planetary configuration indicates that you can expect additional financial resources, perhaps a raise. You deserve it! You've been working long and hard these past several months. You've earned the respect of authority figures and the admiration of peers. Be careful not to fritter away the extra money. Put some aside for a rainy day.",
"You may not want to leave the house today! You may not feel very social and prefer to spend time alone. You could go through old photographs, read old letters, and look through the attic. Pondering memories with a new perspective may clear up some things. With the wisdom and experience you've gained over the years, certain past issues may now finally make sense.",
"Feel free to break ties with certain people now, Aquarius. You may be overextending your emotional bank account by investing too much of yourself in others' lives. You may not even realize how much this sort of action taxes you until you rid yourself of unnecessary baggage. Make phone calls shorter and time in the bathtub longer.",
"You can expect to have a confusing encounter with a friend or colleague today, Aquarius. He or she may come to you for advice but hesitate to reveal the specifics of the problem. You will feel as though you've been asked to mediate an argument, yet you only know one side of the story. Be patient. Gently probe for more details. If they aren't forthcoming, change the subject!",
"A gathering could bring you lots of good news and useful information, Aquarius. The problem is that there might be too much. You will want to remember it all, but your memory may not be as sharp as usual. Before you attend a gathering, grab a notebook and pen. That way you can write down whatever you want to look into later.",
"Don't be afraid to ask for help today, Aquarius. It may be that your friends and family help you with a task or you discover a mechanized solution that does the job for you. Technology can be a wonderful thing. Don't let any aversion to it stop you from incorporating it into your daily life. You will find that once you embrace innovation, it improves your quality of life dramatically.",
"It's likely that you're being held back by certain traumatic past events. Before you can make further progress in your life, Aquarius, you must address these painful memories for the last time. If it feels too frightening to do alone, seek professional help. You will find that mustering the courage to do this difficult, emotional housecleaning is more than half the battle.",
"You may want to take a little trip into your past to visit some old friends, Aquarius. You could find yourself daydreaming through your good and bad memories. This is an excellent period to break with some of the more negative ties to your past. If your partner is a little worried about you going back in time at the moment, reassure him or her.",
"This is an excellent time to share your feelings with the person you love, Aquarius. It might seem a little scary to you. You're usually a reserved person, but you may surprise yourself with the passionate declarations that reflect your happiness now. Take advantage of this, because things could change over the next few days. You may go back into reclusive mode!",
"This is an ideal day to begin a creative venture, Aquarius. You've had many ideas and creative urges. Today it's time to choose one and take the first step to making your vision a reality. You will find that the form will change. This is no reason to be discouraged. It's part of the normal evolution of any work of art. The key here is to begin.",
"A relaxing evening at home may be just what you need, Aquarius, but a colleague might ask you to attend a business-related event. You may have had a stressful few days. Such a party may be the last thing you want to do. Don't be afraid to say no. There will be plenty of colleagues there. At the most, put in a quick appearance and then leave. Right now you need rest more than contacts.",
"This isn't a day for subtle, sensitive people like you, Aquarius. In fact, the winner will probably be the one who shouts the loudest and bangs on the table. The air of aggression will have an effect on you. You could be somewhat upset and more vulnerable than usual. It would be wise for you to stay away from all the commotion.",
"What a day, Aquarius! Whether at work or at home, you may find yourself choosing between two options, both of which stem from anxiety! You may decide to vanquish your doubts by burying yourself in your work. If so, you can expect to expend a great deal of energy. Or you may react with indifference, and the apathy will cost you just as much. The situation will improve in a few days.",
"Think about tolerance, Aquarius, and notice to what extent it can liberate you. If you let others do and think what they like, you will find that you grant yourself this same right. This is the issue of the day for you. It's when you don't allow cultural norms to ruffle your feathers that you can liberate yourself.",
"Your partner may be all over you today, Aquarius! Are you in the mood to listen? Are you interested in some love? Probably not. You may have had a hard day and just feel like some quiet time together. You aren't up to the demands your partner may make on you. You don't need to worry about it. It happens to everyone from time to time.",
"Certain questions about your family life aren't as cut and dried as you might think, Aquarius. This can be the case when emotions are involved. Yet more than anyone else, you need to be careful not to hurt anyone's feelings. Today something could happen that will let you control the situation while controlling your emotions.",
"An unexpected setback could interfere with reaching a long-term goal as soon as you'd hoped. Don't let it get you down, Aquarius. A little innovative thought and extra planning could get you back on track. This is a day best spent alone, working on projects of your own. You're likely to be restless in the company of others. On the upside, good money news could just about make your day!",
"Today you might face a task that seems as workable as emptying the ocean with a teacup. But with help from others, you will not only be able to handle it but also produce exceptional results. Physically, you're likely to feel full of strength and stamina, ready to move mountains. Don't be too surprised if you actually manage to budge a few!",
"Determination could advance career and money matters today. If you've been thinking about striking out on your own, Aquarius, this is the day to start. Some in-depth research might be required. Your need for independence in career matters is high, as well as the courage to go for what you want. Use caution and discretion, but move ahead anyway. Don't let the day's advantages pass you by!",
"With your psychic abilities, you're liable to shed some light on issues in which the truth has been unclear for quite a while, Aquarius. You can use your sensitivity to cut to the heart of the matter and expose the truth. This kind of behavior probably won't come without friction from others. You can almost guarantee that it will. Don't let it faze you. It's important to reveal the truth.",
"You may be confused about asking for help, Aquarius. Your usual resources could be occupied with issues and conflicts that have nothing to do with you. You may then offer to help others. By doing this, you've put someone else's needs above your own. Although this may feel good to you on some level, it's also a way to avoid the problems that you need to deal with.",
"You may feel tense, Aquarius, perhaps because someone close to you disregards the way you feel. You feel as if this person is more concerned with his or her own issues and not concerned about you. Meanwhile, your sensitive, caring heart is well aware of everyone else. You support others and are thoughtful. It's time to rearrange your priorities. First care about yourself, then others.",
"Pressure and worries involving home and family could get in the way of your concentration today, Aquarius. There may have been a quarrel with a household member that weighs on your mind. The best way to deal with this is to give yourself and everyone else time to cool down. Later you're likely to find that it has all blown over.",
"You finally understand that the force of your will can't always determine everything, Aquarius. Your ego is taking a beating, no doubt, but this will help you mature. You accept being wrong and willingly revise your judgment when necessary. In a way, you've just finished your first year at a university for wisdom!",
"You may be taking stock of your professional life, Aquarius. If this is so, be careful to balance strategy with personal objectives. If you're a journalist, think about writing for yourself as well as the paper. You could write novels, poetry, or plays. It doesn't matter what you create so long as it accurately reflects what you feel and is quite apart from your professional life.",
"A friend might be ill, causing you considerable worry. One of the goals you've been trying to reach could be delayed in some way, causing frustration. Your financial situation could also be on your mind. You could be worrying needlessly, Aquarius. The situation is cloudy and may not be as unsettling as it seems. You may have received some misinformation. Check the facts before making yourself crazy.",
"You don't have to be a genius or do something extraordinary in order for people to notice you, Aquarius. It's time you abandon the notion that you can't play a musical instrument because you don't have perfect pitch or that you can't sculpt because you don't have Michelangelo's genius! Dare to engage in any hobby or interest that you fancy.",
"The forecast today is stormy. You may have sensed that there was some tension clouding the conversation at home. Resentments were left unsaid and subtle power games were played without resolution. Today, Aquarius, it all becomes too unbearable for you. Regardless of the risks involved, you will take measures to clear things up.",
"Today's overall outlook is positive for you, Aquarius. You can expect to focus on giving a little more character, expression, or enrichment to your domestic life. You may redecorate a part of the house or find new leisure activities for the children. Don't be reluctant to suggest something original. They will probably enjoy it!",
"Today you may feel especially passionate, Aquarius, and desire a romantic encounter. You might even have a hot date scheduled. Don't be surprised if it has to be postponed for reasons beyond anyone's control. You might try to sublimate those feelings through creative activities. Romantic novels and movies could also prove good outlets, though never as good as the real thing!",
"You should feel especially emotional today, Aquarius, reacting strongly to nearly everything you see, whether a photo of a natural disaster, a group of children, or a kitten sitting on a doorstep. Spiritually, you're highly motivated and longing to know more about worlds beyond this one. You might long to make a pilgrimage, perhaps to a holy shrine or other sacred place. If you're serious, make plans.",
"You have the sensitivity to pick up on what's going on in every situation today, Aquarius. Powerful emotions may conflict with extremely strong opinions. Welcome to the battle between the head and the heart! On this day you may be more apt to side with the heart. Realize that this arena is heated and that the forces around you are extremely stubborn.",
"Here is just the kind of day artists dream about, Aquarius. After yet another lukewarm reception of your artwork, an influential agent shows up and offers to place your paintings in one of the most prestigious museums in the world! This is just an example of the kind of extraordinary event that could be in store for you today. Whatever your pursuits, you have a very good chance of success!",
"Your self-esteem should be strong these days, Aquarius, helping you build more confidence in yourself every day. There may be a glitch in the action today, however, as someone with an extreme perspective on things suddenly steps into the picture. Your emotions may suddenly swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. Do your best to stay calm.",
"You may feel a bit anxious today, Aquarius, and it may be hard to settle down. You probably have many irons in the fire right now, and they're all starting to heat up at once. Unfortunately, other people may not be especially sensitive to your needs, so beware. It might be best to put up some sort of psychic shield to protect yourself from other people's moods.",
"You may be sensitive, Aquarius, but you're also persistent. The waves you've surfed in the past few weeks have only strengthened your resolve. However, you will have to be satisfied with this past period of thrills. The weeks ahead will be much quieter. Use the time to regain some control over your life and work hard to simplify your attitudes.",
"If you're unclear about the topic of discussion, say so, Aquarius. Asking questions is an important part of learning. You shouldn't be afraid to ask. Communication may take on a serious tone, and intellectual discussions are likely to get heated. Bring up political topics at the dinner table and give everyone a chance to speak on the matter. Don't try to change the subject in order to avoid the conversation.",
"You can be quiet and reclusive when it comes to expressing feelings, Aquarius. Today may be the exception. The aspects can bring real strength to your communication abilities. You'd be wise to seize the opportunity. Take steps to express your feelings by initiating conversations. Words will come much more easily than usual. If there are problems to handle, you will likely find resolutions.",
"When it comes to issues of love and romance, you're likely to be in a tough situation, Aquarius. The problem is that it may seem like there's an element of detachment developing. Your partner may be moving away from you instead of toward you. Either that, or you feel that he or she simply isn't relating to you as intimately as you'd like.",
"Your goal for today is to enchant your mate. There's no reason not to try. Indeed, it's an excellent day for love. But don't exaggerate your seductive wiles, Aquarius. Since the day's aspects tend to distort your perception of things, you may be deceived by what you see in the mirror. Be careful about what you do and how you do it!",
"The place you arrive at today may not be quite what you expected, Aquarius. Once you get there, you will find that there is sudden opposition in your camp. Things may not always be exactly what they seem, so check your facts before you make any major decisions. It's better to get the information right from the source rather than depend on what you hear through the grapevine.",
"You may have spent the past few weeks exploring other horizons, Aquarius, meeting new people, going out more frequently, or taking short trips. But there's a significant change of rhythm in the air. You will settle down and bask in the comfort of your home. You will find that you have just the incentive you need to stabilize yourself for a while. Expect some pleasurable moments in the domestic realm.",
"You may feel like your resources are depleted and you want to throw in the towel, Aquarius. Don't give up yet. Today may not be the best day of your life, but that doesn't mean you should write everyone off and become a hermit. You may be moodier than usual, but you will snap out of it. You may need to be a bit more adaptable in order to roll with the punches today.",
"You might feel a bit restless today, Aquarius. You may want to get the word out to others. Unfortunately, your tongue may be tied and it could be hard for you to express yourself exactly the way you want. Balance is key. You should work to foster harmony among your associates. This is a good time to get out and be social.",
"Words may not be the best way to communicate things today, Aquarius. Body language, touch, and taste will be much more effective. You will find that your senses are heightened. Let your feet follow your nose and go enjoy a good meal with someone special tonight.",
"Rid yourself of all regret, Aquarius. Guilt is useless. It doesn't do anyone any good. Your emotions are volatile and apt to erupt in unexpected bursts. Feel free to let it all out. Today isn't the best day to ask for sympathy, but that shouldn't be your goal anyway. Only you can clean out the negative issues that are floating around in your heart and mind.",
"Today is a very expansive day for you, Aquarius. Your emotions can lead you into favorable situations with others. The pace of the day may seem a little slow, but this can be used to your advantage. Examine every detail with care and try not to leave any piece of the equation unaccounted for. You should enjoy a stable, caring mood that radiates out and draws others toward you.",
"Lay low today, Aquarius. Don't try to force any answers from people. Eat a healthy breakfast and stay away from caffeine. Relate to people on an intellectual or philosophical level and discuss the meaning of life. If you're looking for sympathy, you may need to wait a couple days. People aren't in the mood. They just want to be left alone.",
"You would do well to join the intensity of the day, Aquarius. You have the ability to unravel any riddle and find the underlying cause of any dispute. There's a great deal of potential for you to follow through on some major projects today. Work to press through with your ideas. Don't back down. Your sensitivity is your greatest asset. Feel free to express your emotions.",
"Your nurturing instincts are strong today, Aquarius. This is an excellent day to reveal your opinions. You've probably been sitting in the background, quietly observing and collecting data for quite some time. Now is the time to come out of the shadows and let your conclusions be heard. Don't let others push you around. Take a stand for what you know is right.",
"Your intuition is more reliable than your mind today, Aquarius. This is a terrific day in which you should enjoy a good mood and clear head. Your emotions are high, so take advantage of this energy and share it with others. Your generous, nurturing spirit is in demand. If you had a nickel for every good piece of psychological advice you dispense today, you'd be a millionaire.",
"Things may be moving a bit too quickly today for you to grab hold of anything, Aquarius. There's an element of the unexpected entering into the equation. Be prepared. The mood of the day is especially light and perhaps a bit superficial. People may not be entirely reliable. If there's something you absolutely need to do, consider doing it by yourself.",
"There's a powerful force urging you to act today, Aquarius. Someone may be working counter to your aims and trying to rub you the wrong way. Don't let people outwit you. You have just as much right to express your opinions as anyone else. Use the power of your mind to come out on top in any situation. Freedom is a state of mind. Do something that makes you want to dance.",
"You're in line with your warrior instincts today, Aquarius, which reminds you to align with your dreams. The tricky part is how you're going to plan your attack so that there's an equal balance of give and take. Today's prevailing energies may catch you in a difficult situation. Sometimes an outwardly directed, argumentative approach is the only way to push through the roadblock.",
"Watch your back today, Aquarius. There's a distinct presence nearby that requires your attention. Luckily, your emotions are a lot more stable than usual, and you're more strongly connected with your feelings. In fact, you may be in the clouds. You shouldn't have any problem navigating through this part of the atmosphere. Others may look to you for advice.",
"This period is full of difficulties and you will tend to question yourself, especially today. You will start thinking about your personality. Your ego risks bruising, and you will have the greatest difficulty turning your intention into real action. Your sensitivity prevents you from materializing your ideas.",
"Today you will tend to analyze your life. You will think about your lifestyle and the food you eat. Are you eating foods that are good for your body? Are you exercising enough? The stars will help you focus on your health. Health-promoting activities are recommended today, Aquarius. Try to relax and find a sport you enjoy.",
"You shouldn't try to stay alone today, Aquarius. Once in a while you need to spend some time alone to ponder your life, to dream and wish for better things to come. But today you could meet someone who will take you places you aren't accustomed to going. Try to stay available in order to seize this opportunity.",
"You may wonder what all the fuss is about today, Aquarius. People may be getting all worked up over nothing. Don't get absorbed in the melodrama. Set the record straight and bring out the truth as you see it. Don't let others hide behind fa�ades, and don't do the same. It's important that everyone be aware of how you feel.",
"Your head and heart are working in concert today, Aquarius. Things are coming together just as you expected them to. Have confidence in yourself. More than likely, you have the perfect solution to every situation. Maybe your incredible perception of the circumstances will catch someone off guard. Be prepared for some surprised reactions.",
"Don't hide, Aquarius. This is your time to come out of the shadows. There's a spark within that's urging you to act. Move forward and worry about the consequences later. This isn't a good time to search every sentence for hidden meaning. People may be careless with their words. Don't overanalyze them.",
"Proceed with passion, Aquarius. Get out of gloomy mode. Don't sit home and mope. Get out in the sunshine, literally as well as figuratively. Don't stay cooped up inside when there is a big world out there to explore. This is a day to keep things light and energetic. Remember that happiness is a decision.",
"You may feel like someone caught in a tornado, Aquarius. Things are whirling around you and everything seems out of control. Don't get stressed out. There's nothing you can do about it. Allow the storm to do what it will. You will only get hurt if you try to stop it. Accept things you have no control over. The storm will settle down soon.",
"Have you recently lost some faith in the future, Aquarius? Isn't it time to do something about it, especially where your personal life is concerned? You could find the answers to these questions if you'd take a second look at the quality of your close relationships. Who knows? Love might give you back your enthusiasm for life.",
"Plans to get together with a close friend or romantic partner might go awry due to circumstances beyond your control, Aquarius. Sudden events could necessitate being out of touch. You might have to face delays when you're trying to make arrangements. Don't give up - you will reach your goal but just a little later than you'd hoped. Accept things as they are and change your schedule. These things happen.",
"Someone could call and want to share some troubles with you, Aquarius. Your sensitivity and compassion may attract more than one unhappy person in need of sympathy and advice. While this is flattering, it could be a bit of a drag as well. You aren't likely to turn these people away. Accept this as a natural consequence of being a good listener. And take care not to let these sad stories get to you.",
"Some intense dreams about someone you haven't seen for a long time could have you wondering what this person is doing now, Aquarius. It might also awaken the desire to be in contact again. Call if you can. You might be pleasantly surprised. An increased psychic sensitivity could cause you to better understand the thoughts and feelings of family members. Communication of all kinds should go well today.",
"Whatever skills or talents you're using to accomplish your present goals may seem blocked, Aquarius. This could give rise to a sense of frustration if you let it, but don't fall into this trap. If you can't get motivated, focus on something else, perhaps an activity you've never tried before. This could get your mind going again while allowing your other skills to pick up steam.",
"Many of your personal goals have either been met or are in progress, Aquarius, and you're feeling exhilarated. However, people around you might have their hands out. You may be asked to contribute to charities or make personal loans to people you don't know well. You want to help whenever you can, but be discriminating about whom you help now. Some may be less than trustworthy.",
"A despondent friend may need some cheering up. Your ability to nurture and listen sympathetically will definitely prove beneficial, Aquarius. Take care not to absorb any of this person's dejection. Your life should continue to go well with professional successes leading to new friendships and goals. Hang on to your enthusiasm and optimism while showing compassion for others.",
"Today you may want to be left alone with your thoughts. Relaxing with a good book could be at the top of your agenda, Aquarius, and you aren't likely to want to be interrupted. Noise and requests that don't usually bother you might irritate you, so it's best to spend some time alone and make the effort to be your usual considerate self when with others. Take a brisk walk to relieve the tension.",
"Today is a great day to move forward, Aquarius. Your emotions are stable, leaving your heart free to take off to the clouds. Daydream. Now might be a good time to make plans with a romantic partner. Solidify your relationship and confirm your commitment to one another. If you're single, this is a good time to set a plan in motion that will put you one step closer to your greatest fantasy.",
"The opportunity to increase your income could spur you on to channel more energy and inspiration into career matters, Aquarius. Some intense dreams could reveal a lot about you and your motivation, which might increase your self-awareness and make everything easier for you. The drive to succeed in material and spiritual matters is likely to play a powerful role in everything you do.",
"Your emotions may seem a bit muddy today, Aquarius. You might not understand the reason for this. Look to others to share your thoughts. You should find that talking will help you sort through your feelings. If you need to, shift down to second gear for a little more power. Take your time if you need to. Don't let others rush you into believing something that you suspect isn't true.",
"Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, Aquarius. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.",
"Little voices whisper in your ear and ask you to take flight and join them in the clouds, Aquarius. There's tension between what your heart and mind tell you. They're pulling you in very different directions. Don't be surprised if today's energy leaves you confused by sunset. Don't stress about making hard decisions or commitments.",
"Take a break from the seriousness that has prevailed over the past couple days, Aquarius. Upbeat conversations are the way to navigate through today's waters. You might notice that others are more actively communicating and that words are especially effective. You talk and people listen. Do your share of listening, too. The conscious exchange of ideas is critical on a day like this.",
"Your heart could experience some wild fluctuations today, Aquarius. It may seem as if your emotions are on a derailing train. The best thing to do if this is the case is sit by yourself and write them down. Compose a letter, song, or journal entry. You're much less confused than you think. When in doubt, consult someone you love and trust. Go with your instincts.",
"The tension in the air might be what you need in order to become more aware of subconscious issues that affect your behavior, Aquarius. There's a great deal that you need to get off your chest. The more honest you can be about the pain people have caused you, the more love will flow in the future. Open the communication channels.",
"This is an excellent day for you, Aquarius, in which your emotions will be strong. Trust that your instincts are serving you well, better than any other sign. You have nothing to lose by following you heart. This is an important time for you to rekindle the dreams that you've let smolder. Bring more of your fantasy world into your everyday life.",
"You might be sidestepping in order to avoid a commitment today, Aquarius. Don't keep giving someone the runaround. Be strong and let people know your thoughts even if you think their feelings will be hurt. Your job is to protect your emotions. Other people can handle their own. Be aggressive if you have to. Your sanity depends on being true to yourself.",
"It may be hard for you to get a handle on things today, Aquarius. Your focus seems to jump from one problem to the next without finding resolution. This isn't a day to find a solution. You're better off researching, questioning, and gathering facts. Keep your channels of communication open, and don't try to pin anyone down for answers. You'll accomplish a lot by keeping active and light.",
"Keep up your psychic shield, Aquarius, because you will need it. People's comments may seem harsh even if they may mean well. Your best defense against the critical tone of the day is to use other people's criticisms as constructively as you can in order to build a stronger framework from which to work. Process this energy in a positive frame of mind. Use it to get things done.",
"People are going to appreciate extra long hugs today, Aquarius, so give them out like candy to everyone you meet. A kind gesture and warm word won't be forgotten. Let your generous and kind spirit shine through. Open your arms wide to spread love to the world around you. It's the perfect day for laughter and affection, so do your part.",
"Today you may wake up and realize that there is serious room for improvement, Aquarius. If decorating isn't your strong suit, why not call in the professionals? In the meantime, there's a lot you can do by simply clearing away the clutter and reorganizing your bookcases in a more attractive way. Mingle some artwork and knickknacks among the books for a more interesting visual effect.",
"Walk to the beat of your own drum, Aquarius. If you try to latch on to the smooth-talking, fast-paced information of the day, your voice could get lost in the crowd. But if you plant your feet firmly and try to plan, you might deprive yourself of spontaneous events that prove the most fulfilling. Chart your own course and don't be afraid if no one else follows along.",
"Be brazen and bold in your actions today, Aquarius. This may be a hard direction for you at first, but it's the most effective way to get where you need to go. Unexpected ripples of emotion may cause you to go in an unconventional direction. Let yourself flow freely. This is an important time to get up and moving in response to these powerful emotions.",
"Guard your heart well today, Aquarius. It's a prime target for the abrasive words being tossed around. Your sensitivity leaves you feeling alone and naked in the harsh atmosphere. You might be better off staying in bed. If you decide to go out, be prepared. Know your weaknesses so you can use your energy resources most efficiently.",
"You may feel especially emotional today, Aquarius, reacting strongly to just about every image you see, whether it's a war photo or a kitten on a doorstep. Spiritually, you're highly motivated and longing to know more about the world. You might find yourself thinking of making a pilgrimage. If you're serious, make your plans now.",
"The day will be fairly eventful, Aquarius. There's some likelihood that you will feel compelled to finally settle some tedious matter, either the details of a project or a problem concerning your domestic life. You won't rest until it's finished, and you won't be distracted, no matter how you're cajoled to join the others. The only thing that will matter to you will be solving this problem.",
"Instead of turning all your burning questions inward today, Aquarius, you might want to consider broadcasting them outward. Engage in discussions and extend your queries to the group. You may usually try to solve all the world's problems on your own, but once in a while you should stop and consider other points of view in order to enrich your perspective.",
"Aquarius, you finally begin to feel like you're making progress. You're intent on completing some projects that have long been in the works. After many hours of concentration and focus, you make the last adjustments and proclaim it finished. You can expect to be rewarded for your efforts. Your skills are extraordinary. You can enjoy a real sense of satisfaction. Celebrate a little!",
"Others are apt to play a big role in the events that unfold today, Aquarius. It's likely that closely communing with others will be very important. Despite this, you may still feel alone. Even within a large group, your heart may yearn to bond tightly with just one other person. Do your best to stay positive regardless of the combative forces likely to be at work on a day like this.",
"Take an adventurous approach, Aquarius, especially when it comes to love and romance. Don't get moody or down in the dumps when things don't seem to be going your way. It's up to you to change your attitude. Trust that things will improve when you turn the corners of your mouth up instead of down. Stop worrying about every little issue that comes up. Take it all in stride.",
"Much of your focus today will be on personal possessions and material goods in general, Aquarius. Think about what you can do to improve your home. Make your physical surroundings comfortable and inviting. Spend time alone in your sanctuary where you can center and concentrate on the big picture. Physical comfort and beauty will translate into emotional security.",
"Your emotions are active, Aquarius, and could be popping up in powerful outbursts. There's momentum building within that you shouldn't ignore or suppress. Perhaps you feel that what you have to say isn't appropriate for the situation. More than likely, it will do more harm than good to ignore these feelings rather than get them out, even when it seems disruptive to do so.",
"You may feel like you're walking a tightrope, Aquarius. One wrong step will cause you to tumble to the ground. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. You may see things as life or death situations when what's required now is an upbeat attitude. If you insist on making things more complicated than they need to be, you may turn away the very people who can help you.",
"Try not to rock the boat too much today, Aquarius. Hold fast to your point of view, but don't get down when other people don't share your sentiments. You might feel the urge to snap at people, but realize that you're probably better off holding your tongue. Let your daydreams carry you away from the present reality. Your imaginary world will be your closest ally.",
"Your thinking may have emotional overtones that prevent you from seeing the truth clearly, Aquarius. Do your best to tame your feelings in order to let more rational thoughts rise to the surface. There's a stability that comes when you honor your emotions from a detached perspective instead of immediately taking action in response to how you feel. Think about this as you engage with others.",
"If you're in a debate, don't back down, Aquarius. The major advantage you have over your opponents is your keen power of observation. It enables you to pick up on the energy around you. You know exactly what other people are thinking and where their arguments are going. You'll be able to keep explosive issues from getting out of hand. Be aggressive if you feel it's needed to control the situation.",
"Slow and steady actions are likely to win the race today, Aquarius. Unexpected situations may crop up to throw you off course, but don't let them. Stay on your path and try not to give in to the wild, erratic energy around you. Stick to traditional methods and beware of peddlers trying to sell you wooden nickels. You're smarter than that.",
"You feel like a scared child who wants to hide under the bed today, Aquarius. Keep in mind that there are just as many monsters under the bed as there are out in the world. At least you can see the ones outside and perhaps even enlist the help of others to combat them. Don't shut yourself in during this time of great upheaval. Your opinion is just as valid as anyone else's.",
"If there is something you need to fight for, this is the time to do it, Aquarius. For a while now you've been doing research on the best way to proceed. The time has come to take action. You have an extra boost of vitality, and your warrior instinct is strong. You feel like a volcano ready to expel boiling hot lava. Trust and follow your instincts.",
"If you've been hesitant about whether you should go on a diet, this would be a great day to start, Aquarius. If you're one of those people who really doesn't have to watch what you eat, good for you! However, you should still stay away from rich foods. Don't drink too much alcohol, and stay away from a lot of chocolate.",
"You're feeling altruistic today, Aquarius. You're eager to do what you can for others. You can now put into action all those lofty visions of volunteering for a worthy cause. It's time to do some real work. You'll be astonished at how great it feels to make a direct contribution. Spending time chopping vegetables in a soup kitchen is much more satisfying than mailing a check.",
"Today is a relatively calm day that's sure to please you, Aquarius. You may even receive gifts from family and friends as marks of their esteem or love for you. This is just the kind of reassurance you need. Though you have a fairly subtle influence in your relationships with others, it's nevertheless essential to you to be a good friend.",
"Your thinking is clear today, Aquarius, but it might be hard to take action on your thoughts. A restrictive force may seem to be holding you back. A sense of discipline is welling up within you, reminding you to add a touch of conservatism to whatever it is that you have in mind. Take the opportunity to pursue tasks that require you to be reserved and collected.",
"Spend time with someone you love today, Aquarius, but keep things light and easy. Don't go too deep, and don't expect others to necessarily feel the things you feel. You might feel slighted when others don't give you the attention that you think you deserve. Don't take it personally. Others may be unfocused and short of attention. Don't expect any major commitments or deep conversations right now.",
"Your subconscious mind is active today, Aquarius. You might have psychic insights and some odd dreams. However convoluted they may be, they're trying to tell you something, possibly about your relationship with a friend or love partner. Make a list of the symbols and then figure out what they mean to you. The symbols in these dreams are probably all very personal.",
"A friend could seem distant today, Aquarius, and probably won't be communicating with you much. Don't jump to the conclusion that your friend is upset with you. If anything, this person is probably worried about his or her job. Just be your usual friendly self, don't push, and go about your business. Your friend will talk when the time is right.",
"A miscommunication with a business or romantic partner might cause some ruffled feathers today, Aquarius. You can divert this by explaining the facts clearly whenever you give information. Make sure your partner understands what you're saying before they go and act on it! For your own part, don't be shy about asking what someone means. Remember, it's better to ask a stupid question than make a dumb mistake!",
"Today you might feel an overwhelming physical attraction to a new person even if you're already involved, Aquarius. Also, an unusual stroke of luck could bring some extra money your way. It could be an unexpected bonus, a sale of some kind, or a gift. The temptation to spend it all at once could arise. If you don't need the money for routine expenses, go for it! You deserve a reward.",
"If you've been feeling less like yourself lately, Aquarius, a surge of inner power could push you over the top and make you feel strong and healthy again. You could decide to finish the unfinished tasks around you today. You might get most of them done by day's end. Don't forget to enjoy yourself, however. You will want to make the most of your newfound energy.",
"If you're not married or engaged, Aquarius, you may feel that your current love interest is avoiding you. However, this is just your imagination. Relationships always go through ups and downs, so don't worry. If you have serious doubts whether there's something wrong, ask your partner.",
"Today you might feel very low, Aquarius, though you may not have any idea why. Your life is going well, so there's no real reason for you to feel this way. Chances are that you saw something that triggered an unconscious memory without even being aware of it. Discern what it was and then release it. Find something to do that you love!",
"Relationships should go well for you, Aquarius. You should be able to find emotional stability when you form a relationship with someone you trust. Don't get discouraged if this person tends to be aloof. Your friend is just giving you space to breathe and grow. Direct more of your energy outward so you may begin to manifest the ideas that you store up inside.",
"The execution of contracts and other legal documents looks favorable now, Aquarius. You might consider going into business, perhaps in a partnership with some friends. This looks good, but there's a chance that one of them has been keeping things from you, and this might make you angry. Honest communication is necessary in order to succeed at a new enterprise.",
"Just because your heart is feeling extra generous now doesn't mean that you need to send flowers to everyone you know, Aquarius. On a day like this you should channel all your incredible love and affection to one special person. Help him or her feel like an important part of your life.",
"Your thoughts may be scattered and confused, Aquarius, especially regarding responsibilities that are important to you. You need to be disciplined and focused, but frivolous chatter may fill your brain. This kind of mental muddle limits you in many situations, making it difficult to express what you feel. Ask someone who knows you well to help you make sense out of these thoughts.",
"You may need to deal with disapproval today, Aquarius. This will likely come from someone you see as a superior or authority figure, perhaps a parent or teacher. While it's important to listen, if what they have to say involves your personal life and how you live it, it's no one's concern but yours. No matter what you do, someone will disapprove of something!",
"Learning about things that interest you most is something you may want to do today. At work and home, there's a schedule to tend to. On your own time, you're free to learn about anything your heart desires. Intellectual growth is something you enjoy. Whether you delve into cooking, astrophysics, or genealogy, you'll find something new.",
"Be careful of letting a sour mood ruin your day, Aquarius. You may not feel particularly cheerful. This is liable to have a dramatic effect on everyone else. Be aware of the fact that your mood may not be an accurate reflection of reality, even though for the most part your world is centered on your moods and the dramatic swings they go through within one day.",
"It might be time to face a recent failure, Aquarius. No one is exempt from disappointment, of not succeeding at something. It's part of reaching a goal, no matter who you are or what you've done in the past. Even the most accomplished people have had to face this. You aren't alone in your feelings. Give it another shot. Things will work out.",
"Someone could approach you today offering an opportunity to increase your income, which may seem too good to be true. It might be all they say, Aquarius, but look into the facts before making promises to go ahead with it. All may not be as it seems! Today isn't a good day to commit to investments of any kind. Wait a few days, consider the idea again, and see if it's workable.",
"You might find it hard to get going, Aquarius. Taking direction could rub you the wrong way, especially if you're set on doing something different. Communicate your ideas and how you want to approach things rather than let irritation get to you. Your approach will be better received if you leave emotions out of it. You may even get kudos for staying calm and collected.",
"If someone you know is going through a rough time, Aquarius, they could come to you for support or advice. People see you as genuinely concerned and a good friend, especially when times are tough. You've probably earned their respect through your caring and helpfulness. By being such a good friend, you're surrounded by people who will be there for you when you need them.",
"Malfunctions on the part of computers, ATMs, and phone systems could interfere with financial transactions today, Aquarius. You might have to pay for purchases in the old-fashioned way - cash or checks. This isn't a good day to begin or complete any major financial transactions. There's too much confusion right now. Wait a few days.",
"You might feel a bit rough around the edges today, Aquarius. There's a bite to the day that could leave you feeling upset and unnerved. It may seem as if no one understands you. By opening up to others, you'll allow them to open up to you. People will be anxious to learn the inner workings of your mind. You have a great deal of personal wisdom to share.",
"Today you could spend a lot of time running errands. There might be delays due to circumstances beyond your control. You could experience that old mounting frustration. There's no use fighting the invisible foe. Accept the fact that you may not be able to accomplish everything you'd set out to do. Treat yourself to a quiet evening.",
"If you're trying to get your finances together, today might not be the best day for it, Aquarius. Put it aside for now. Indulge in the lighter side of life. Get family or close friends together and head outside. You can enjoy a day at the park or zoo. Share some laughs and grow closer. Those more serious matters will still be waiting for you tomorrow.",
"It may seem like everyone else has a purpose and project except you, Aquarius. While everyone is charging out of the gate, you may still be unsure that this is the race you want to run. Don't push yourself into something you don't want to do. The energy of the day is fast and adventurous, but if you aren't feeling up for a fight, don't force it.",
"Don't get discouraged if it seems like everyone but you is getting a piece of the pie, Aquarius. Your time will come, but it probably won't be today. While you may want to sink into tender feelings and sensitivity, others may want to float on the surface and dabble in fantasy worlds. Feel free to escape in your own world for a while, but don't be surprised if others don't follow.",
"Someone may skip out on responsibilities today, Aquarius, causing extra tasks to fall to everyone else, including you. This might stir up some anger and resentment and it's definitely going to cause more stress. Delegate tasks if you can. Put yours in order of urgency and then take them one at a time slowly and carefully. If the less important ones have to wait until tomorrow, so be it!",
"When the thought of going to work makes it hard to get out of bed, know that the time has come to get another job, Aquarius. Alas, that's probably not something you can do now. You can be extra kind to yourself. Give yourself a present. Find something you thoroughly enjoy that would perk up your spirits and cost little.",
"Who knew you were so talented, Aquarius? A creation done long ago suddenly takes on a life of its own. A short story written and submitted long ago is pulled from the bottom of the slush pile. Or a portrait you painted gets a second admiring look. Whatever the circumstances, you enjoy the recognition. Your work isn't the only thing receiving admiring glances. Your partner appreciates you, too!",
"Have you recently purchased something you wanted that's more of a luxury than a necessity? Today you might feel guilty about it. It may have temporarily strained your budget. Don't even think about taking it back! Sometimes luxury items can lift the spirits. Payday will be around again before you know it.",
"If you're presently romantically involved, Aquarius, you could find that one of you feels very passionate while the other doesn't. Compromise! If you're currently unattached, someone for whom you feel nothing could express an interest in you that's more than friendly. This is a difficult situation, but you have to sidestep this person's attentions without hurting any feelings.",
"Strange, exciting, and vivid dreams may inspire your creativity today. You might want to try a new art form or study the works of innovators. Romance and sex are especially important to you, Aquarius, though insecurities about a partner may restrain you from expressing your feelings. Take a chance - let the person know what you need right now. Your friend may be pleasantly surprised.",
"You may be asked to turn yourself inside out today, Aquarius. People may bombard you in a way that makes you want retreat into your protective shell. Let their steam dissipate before you pull out your witty, well-crafted retort. Your cutting sense of sarcastic humor is exactly what's needed to puncture any inflated, superficial egos.",
"You might host a gathering of friends and neighbors interested in astrology, tarot, numerology, or other forms of psychic focus, Aquarius. You'll probably enjoy yourself, both because of the information discussed and the camaraderie between you and your guests. This might have been planned as a one-time thing, but everyone will have so much fun that you'll plan another meeting.",
"Good news regarding money could have you thinking in terms of freshening up your home. You might want to do some painting or add some small decorative touches like art or houseplants. You might even want to shop for some new furniture. This promises to be a lot of fun, Aquarius, so get family members to do it with you.",
"You're often preoccupied by other people's lives. Your devotion to others will be appreciated today, Aquarius. For example, in the family circle, you may have to bandage everyone's little physical or psychological wounds. Don't neglect your energy needs. As you're aware, you need all the strength you can muster.",
"Remind yourself of all the positive things you have going on in your life now, Aquarius. It's possible that you'll be met with tension and challenges today that are threatening your sense of self. Arguments may break out around you, and you may have questions regarding what it is you stand for. Don't lose touch with your nurturing qualities and sixth sense.",
"Your mind is especially keen today, Aquarius. You'll find that it communes well with your anxious heart. Someone may have recently stepped into your life and now it's time to engage with this person on a deeper level. It's wise to take things one step at a time. Don't let your imagination get carried away. It could be hard to find the line between imaginary and actual.",
"Purchases for your home might be one of your projects today. Your aesthetic sense is very high right now and your good taste at a peak. You're likely to be more attracted to the unusual and unconventional than usual. Unexpected but welcome visitors could come to your door, and some fascinating conversations could result. You might even host an impromptu event.",
"A powerful creative urge may come upon you today. Your intuition should play a strong role in whatever you produce. You may feel driven to finish your project. The only downside might be that your partner may not understand why you want to work instead of go out. Follow your heart and keep working. Your friend will see it differently when you show the results.",
"Some work on your house's infrastructure might be needed today. The plumbing or electricity might be giving you problems, but you'll be glad when the repairs are done. Your house will probably run more efficiently. For this reason, it's best not to try to make the repairs yourself. Even if you're somewhat skilled in this area, call a professional.",
"If you need to do any serious investigative work, today's the day for it. Your powers of concentration are stronger than normal and you're more interested in what lies below the surface. If you suspect another person's actions or motives, this would be a good day to call him or her on it. Make sure that you're both being honest.",
"Today a piece of information for which you've been searching could suddenly become known. You might use your business and money-management skills to help a friend or a group with which you're affiliated. You'll have some good pointers to impart. Gratitude, if not financial compensation, should be forthcoming. Put your nose to the grindstone and get going!",
"Your tasks should go smoothly and quickly today, particularly paperwork. Others are willing to lend a hand if you need it, and you might be called upon to assist another with a task beyond his or her ability. The atmosphere is unusually pleasant, so the day could just fly by. In the evening, go to a bookstore that's holding a lecture or book signing.",
"Your heartstrings may not feel particularly strong, and this situation isn't likely to get any better today when you find that people are insensitive to your situation. This isn't a good time to rely on others to pick you up. Put on your protective armor before you go out the door. The forecast calls for pushy moods and hostile attitudes.",
"You may feel like a mouse trying to get the cheese in the middle of the kitchen floor. From your corner, you can see the cheese in the distance. Yet you know a cat lurks nearby. As soon as you step into the open and out of your protected spot, the cat will react quickly and with great force. You might just want to wait until another day before grabbing the cheese.",
"People might step on your toes today, but try not to react. Go with the flow. This may be the only way they know how to act. Express your feelings. Open yourself up to the world. There are people who want to get closer to you, but they might feel too intimidated to do so. Take it one step at a time, but realize that you're probably the one who needs to take the first step.",
"If you're trying to learn a computer program, you might obsess about it. In fact, it might even haunt your dreams. It could be frustrating, dreaming about math and computers when you're more used to vivid images, but look at the dreams anyway. Should your mind be operating in a more scientific manner right now? Does something in your life not \"add up\"?",
"The intensity should increase around an issue regarding love and romance. Friction is building. Unfortunately, this tension may be unavoidable. It's likely that some sort of power struggle is being thrown into the mix, and you may fight for control of your emotions. Try not to get sucked into a bottomless pit.",
"You might consider entering a business partnership of some kind with friends. This is a good time because your communication is especially good. Details of each person's role can be worked out clearly. Though it's admittedly going to take some effort, success is indicated for just about any goal.",
"You should team up with others and initiate action that resonates with your inner being. This might not be obvious now, but be on the lookout for unexpected events. These energies alert you to the fact that there's a much larger trend moving through your life that you may not be aware of right now. Stand back from your everyday routine and get a better perspective on your direction.",
"A new addition to your routine may be in the works. Whether this involves work that produces additional income or is of a voluntary nature, you can expect your tasks to change in some way, probably for the better. You could also be thrown in with people you find compatible.",
"Too much partying could have you feeling a little under the weather. The food and drink may have been great, but today you'd better eat plain but nourishing food. You may not be inclined to exercise, but a brisk walk or yoga class might be just what you need. It will also clear your head. You should be yourself again by midafternoon.",
"An impromptu gathering including some neighbors could take place today. Someone could start a round of gossip, and this could turn you off. You might wonder if they're going to start in on you when you leave! Don't stick around. Listening to such talk could give you a headache. Gossip is the last refuge of people who have no life.",
"Traffic in your neighborhood could be congested beyond anything you've seen before. Perhaps an accident or road construction is blocking the street. It may be nearly impossible to get anywhere by car, even the grocery store. If you must go out, either walk or ride a bike or it might take an hour to do what would normally take a few minutes. Better yet - stay home!",
"Cupid may have struck you unawares. Your libido could be in high gear today and you're ready for love. You look and feel great. Try your best to reach the one you love. If it isn't possible to get together this evening, see if you can plan a romantic interlude soon. If all else fails, dive into a romance novel and escape that way.",
"You have a gentle way of expressing yourself to your loved one. It isn't your style to make grand gestures or buy extravagant gifts. You prefer to spend quality time together, talking and cuddling. Today you may be in an unusually romantic mood and confess the depth of your feelings. This will have just the effect you hope for!",
"If you're single, you might long for a romantic partner today. If you're attached, you might think of making your commitment more permanent. If you're married, children might be on your mind. Whatever your situation, and whatever it is you're searching for now, look your best when encountering current or potential partners. You'll probably get the response you want!",
"You're likely to feel pulled in two directions today. You're at a high point in your career and don't want to lose the momentum. At the same time, you feel strongly that you'd like to spend extra time with your loved ones. If only you could be in two places at once! Have you considered telecommuting for the next few weeks? Your family would enjoy having you around.",
"You're feeling especially sensitive today. Your intuition is operating at a very high level. With people wearing their hearts on their sleeves now, it's very easy to tap into others' emotions. You and your mate are especially in sync, which will make for a wonderful evening. Take advantage of the aspects and broach a sensitive subject you've wanted to discuss.",
"Your hard work is finally paying off. You can expect to receive acknowledgement and advancement, along with a possible salary increase or substantial bonus. You should receive the good news soon. Celebrate tonight with family and friends. They could also have some good news of their own to report, which makes for happiness all around.",
"You could feel a great deal of pressure from the people around you to join in their festivities. Perhaps you're being lured into the frenzy of activity. Don't feel like you have to be a part of the party if you don't want to be. The worst thing for you to do would be to pretend that you're interested when you aren't.",
"Your writing and speaking abilities are operating at a high level today. If you've been thinking about pursuing either of these avenues, starting now gives you an advantage toward attaining success. Make a start and get your ideas down on paper, however rough they may be. The only downside is the stress that might result from the sudden stimulation.",
"The more action you take today, the bigger the hole you're apt to dig for yourself. You could be engaged in one of those situations in which you say one thing and then are forced to stretch the truth or outright lie in order to defend your point. You're then put in a very vulnerable position. Try your best to avoid this trap.",
"Today's intense celestial energy will help you make progress toward your goals. Your mind will be quick and receptive and your writing and speaking abilities especially acute. You might feel that you could sell anything to anyone if you wanted to. Make the most of this intellectual power. Start new projects now. If you do, success is more than likely.",
"A long-awaited romantic encounter may be canceled or prove less rewarding than you'd hoped. Doubts about the future of this relationship could come up. This isn't the day to make any final decisions about serious matters like this. Wait a few days until you feel a little more confident and then make up your mind.",
"Lack of contact with a close friend or romantic partner might find you feeling lonely and insecure, wondering if he or she has forgotten you or simply doesn't care to be around you anymore. This is more likely your insecurity than anything based in reality. Sometimes people are busy! Give your friend a call. Chances are the person will be very glad to hear from you.",
"A lot of your time today could be spent working on financial matters on the computer, phone, or other form of technology. This could have to do with your job or it could concern personal finances. Whichever it is, you'll do a good job, as success in accomplishing whatever you work on is indicated. One way or another, career success is coming your way.",
"Self-image could be a difficult issue for you. Perhaps you've painted a false picture of yourself lately. In an effort to cover your insecurity, you may not have expressed how you feel to some people. When you look in a mirror, you may find that the person you see is quite different than the person other people see. This conflict may put you in some uncomfortable situations.",
"You may feel like a snail emerging from its shell. When no one is looking, you slowly and cautiously stick your head out and put up your antennae to take a reading on the outside world. When you see a creature like you, you feel comfortable and come out of your shell a bit more. Be careful about letting your defenses down too much, because a big, hungry bird may be looking for dinner.",
"If you feel suffocated by your romantic relationship, if you feel it lacks spice or is too traditional, then why not liberate yourself? Today's planetary energy will help you turn even your craziest ideas into reality. Starting today, you're going to be asked to be more decisive.",
"Some interesting dreams could come to you tonight. Don't be fooled by confusing symbolism. These dreams could shed light on business concerns you've been trying to work out. Make a list of the symbols and see what they're trying to tell you. Then if it makes sense, act on it. Your dreams are probably only revealing what your subconscious has already worked out.",
"Your mind should be especially quick and agile today, and your curiosity will be piqued. Your pursuit of intellectual interests could lead to group activities where you meet others interested in the same subjects. A lot of information could come your way. You'll enjoy discussing it. New friendships and lines to other possible interests could come your way.",
"Plans to get together with friends tonight could be delayed by responsibilities. It won't stop you but it will mean getting together a little later. Someone close to you might feel a little down and seek a sympathetic ear. Try to get this person to forget his or her insecurities and see the situation as it is.",
"A call from a close friend or love partner could bring good news today. You'll be so happy about it that you'll want to get word out to everyone you know. This could involve romance or it might concern a creative project of some kind, perhaps involving writing and speaking. In the evening you'll probably want to go out and celebrate with the person who brought you the news.",
"If you've felt the desire to write something, now is the time to do it. You certainly don't lack imagination. Your problem may be that you have difficulty taking your prose seriously. Don't think so seriously about being \"a writer.\" Just write and let people read what you write. A writer's group would be a great way for you to come out of hiding.",
"Job stress might be getting to you. Drinking a lot of water would be a good idea. Moderate amounts of exercise and rest are also indicated. Don't eat very spicy foods. This is a good day to catch up on reading, studying, or research. Your physical self may not be what it should be, but your brain is sharp.",
"You might be jumping around today. This is one of those situations in which you don't want to stay in one place for too long. Each place is an individual step that leads to where you want to go. Keep your eyes focused ahead and keep on going. Stagnating will leave you lost in the middle of nowhere.",
"Tension in the romance department may arise for you. You want to get things started in a relationship that's important to you, yet something always seems to stand in the way of the plan. Instead of trying to sidestep your way into the picture, take a direct approach. If you don't try, you're just as bad off as if you'd tried and failed. Go for it.",
"You may be indirectly affected by a struggle. A heated debate having to do with mistaken communication and extreme emotions might devastate your psyche unless you keep up your defenses. The acting planetary energy is forming an arena for emotional turmoil. Whether you want to or not, you're probably going to get sucked into it.",
"You could have some very strange yet beautiful dreams today. Write them down. They're trying to tell you something. You could also make an off-the-wall plan to increase your income that may or may not work. Consider all the aspects of your plan and get in touch with the reality of it before delving too far. It might be workable but not in the ways you think now.",
"Romance might take a front seat in your thoughts today. You could have some unusual dreams tonight. They might be romantic or they could prove artistically inspiring, or both. Write them down, for they may reveal new facts about you that could make a difference. Your thoughts about money could sway between confidence and panic. Don't lose sight of the facts!",
"Indulge your sensual nature today. This part of your being doesn't get expressed regularly. Go for a long walk with someone you love. Light some candles in your bedroom or take a leisurely hot bath. Tastes and smells are extra potent for you now. Enjoy a romantic dinner for two. Don't get so caught up in the intellectual aspect of things that you forget about the sensuous side of life.",
"Are you planning to attend a lecture or workshop? This is a good day for it. Your mind and emotions are working together to bring insights your way. Your common sense is operating at a very high level, so this is also a good day to make practical decisions. Communication with those who share your interests should be both gratifying and enlightening.",
"It may be hard to find your mental and physical home base. Your mind could be wrapped in a cloud or some sort of imaginative time warp, so be careful how you proceed. Your head is in another dimension and you aren't paying nearly enough attention to the road ahead of you. Get off the highway and let your mind wander in a place where it's safe to do so.",
"You may feel emotionally good but the more you express yourself the more critical others become of your sensitivity. Unfortunately, you may clam up under such circumstances. Hang onto the fact that you have something valuable to teach, but other people aren't ready to learn. Try not to take it personally.",
"Take a more adaptable approach. Go with the flow and let things merge on the foundation that has already been established. You're holding on tightly to a security blanket. This tattered piece of cloth gives you peace. The threat of losing it frightens you. It's time to throw it away and know you're better off operating without that extra burden.",
"Work and career matters could finally bring you the success and good fortune you've been hoping for. This may be acknowledgement for effort and dedication as well as hard work. Expect a raise, and increased respect and status among friends and co-workers. Don't celebrate so much that you suffer the effects of overindulging!",
"Sudden insights and revelations could enable you to make some long-desired changes. A lucky break might bring an unexpected sum of money your way. Unusual dreams could amuse you during the night. Keep track of them as they might contain messages that can help you accomplish whatever you want to do. This is a day of fortunate developments and pleasant surprises.",
"Love, affection, and romance seem to be all around you. Strong unity with close friends, family members, and your romantic partner may well up throughout the day. You can also expect a rush of imagination and artistic inspiration, perhaps generated by the support of those around you. Any relationships formed now will last a long time. Recall this day when times get tough.",
"Short trips and long talks with your special someone are on the agenda today. You may decide to drive into the country, perhaps to visit quaint shops and rustic restaurants. A confusing call could come from an acquaintance this evening. The person won't seem to be telling you anything yet expect some kind of feedback. Don't be afraid to ask for an explanation!",
"Don't give up on finding the romantic partner of your dreams, because now is your chance. Talk is spurring you to take action. Don't be surprised if a bit of friction keeps you from jumping into the situation with both feet. Hang in there. Once you get below the surface, you'll find that there's much more to this person than first meets the eye.",
"Today you might be in the right mood to organize. High-tech equipment may be of help in this project, and so could the help of friends. An optimistic, enthusiastic attitude will sustain you through any tasks. You will be more than happy with what you've accomplished by day's end. Treat yourself. Go out and celebrate - you deserve it!",
"Your association with a group could enable your spiritual progress today. Past emotional issues could come up, but don't despair. Look at it as an opportunity to release old traumas that have limited you. Transcending limitations of any kind - emotional, spiritual, or physical - is an especially productive approach. You'll release a lot and come out of the experience with new focus.",
"You'll probably feel a little lost today. You'll have to come to a decision in the near future, and your life will be greatly affected by it. Should you listen to your desires? Should they be in charge of your life? Or should you try to rein in your feelings and take the more practical route? It's something to think about.",
"You have a pleasant day ahead. People may be a little less playful, but they'll be all the more caring in their relationships. That's just how you like them! Everything is on your side for you to express your feelings to someone close. Do it now! This atmosphere will only last a few days.",
"Expect to get some fabulous news today. You'll finally get your due. It may be a promotion, raise, challenging new project, or some combination of these. You could also receive good news in the romance department. You have certainly made the effort, some of it superhuman. Now you'll be rewarded. Accept with your usual aplomb and style any gifts the day brings.",
"You're probably doing better financially than you have for a long time, but you still might not have reached some of the monetary goals you'd set. This could be on your mind today. If you aren't careful, you could work yourself into a frenzy. It might be more productive to calmly find a way to progress more quickly. You can do it.",
"You're especially attuned to the feelings of others. This gift is more blessing than curse, yet there are times when it's hard not to take on the troubles of others. Today a close friend may unload his or her burdens on you. Listen kindly, offer advice, but don't offer to do more than is realistic. After all, this isn't your problem.",
"Information you receive from friends could have you worrying a little about your financial security. You may be trying to reach a goal that seems to be in jeopardy - if the news you've heard is true. It may not be! Check the facts before jumping to conclusions and panicking. You could find that there's nothing to worry about.",
"Out with the old and in with the new! That seems to be your mantra for the day, especially where your home is concerned. Your energy and motivation are high. If anyone can execute a complete one-day redecoration, you can. But even you can get hurt when trying to move a sofa by yourself. Enlist help, but be careful not to work them too hard. Not everyone has your energy!",
"You may be feeling way too serious at the moment. Whether you know it or not, you're in dire need of cheering up. If someone invites you to a comedy club, go. It may take you a while to get into it, but you'll end the evening laughing. It will be the best night of your month. If you can, stop second-guessing yourself.",
"Your mood will be up and down and back and forth over the course of the day. You're riding high from the past couple days, and you feel more bonded with the people at your side. You feel a nurturing love from someone who's keeping your heart happy and your mind at ease. Toward the end of the day you may feel that people aren't as sincere as they seemed at first. Stay on guard.",
"There's intensity in your relationships now, and you may feel like every situation is life-or-death. Calm those voices in your head. Meditate, take a yoga class, and breathe deeply. Know that nothing is really as dramatic as it seems. This, too, will pass. In a few days you'll be able to laugh your worries away.",
"A separation from the special someone in your life, perhaps because of a minor disagreement, could have you feeling melancholy today. You could receive an invitation to a get-together but be unlikely to want to go. You're feeling more reserved and introverted than usual. Oddly enough, being with others is probably the best way to get your mind off your friend.",
"Dreams and meditation could bring up deep-seated emotions from the past that have been blocking your growth without your realizing it. Both seeking and giving forgiveness may take on new importance. Romantic passion should be at an all-time high. These emotions are also likely to provide artistic inspiration that you want to turn toward decorating your home.",
"A long-term dream toward which you've been working for a long time, could finally show signs of coming true. You're feeling especially energetic and enthusiastic now, so you might feel motivated to give it one last push to finally make your dream reality. You'll probably go out with friends or members of a group you belong to and celebrate tonight.",
"Your current paradigm may get shifted a bit. There's a good chance that your emotions will go through a significant transformation today. Your mind may be spinning. Don't get caught up in the mental maelstrom. You can cut through the jargon that your mind may be feeding you by relying on your sixth sense - your keen intuition - for the answers you seek.",
"This will be an excellent day to start some of the projects you've held back for some time. You'll likely feel more physical and mental energy than you've experienced lately.

You can branch out, reach toward others, and make important connections that will help move you toward success and good fortune. There's opportunity available to you today, so don't blow it by letting your emotions get the better of you!"]
