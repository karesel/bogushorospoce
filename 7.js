"Take a look at what's going on around you today, Libra, and do some internal processing before you reach a conclusion regarding the best way to proceed. You may find that a combination of powerful forces is trying to win you over to their camp. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of doing things. Keep in mind that the best route is often a combination of several different paths.",
"Turn up your fantasy dial and let your imagination run wild. Your intuition is strong today, Libra, and you should give your emotions room to flow. Work to clear the blockages that keep you from doing things you truly want to do. Get your ideas on paper and manifest more of your fantasy world in reality. People may be stingy, so now isn't the best time to ask for a raise or loan.",
"There are opportunities open to you now whether you realize it or not. It may be hard to be aware of them today, given the astrological weather. Your emotions may feel restricted and weighed down, like something is trying to tie you down. Realize that this is just a message from the Universe reminding you that having at least one foot on the ground is key to manifesting your dreams.",
"Enjoy the calm morning, Libra, because things are going to get crazier and more energetic as the day goes on. Emotions will run high, and people will be more opinionated than usual.

"Today shows the promise of being a very busy yet fulfilling day, Libra. Enterprises involving corporations, churches, or other groups in your community are likely to benefit from your participation. You combine intuition with practicality in everything you do. You're especially communicative and good at dealing with others. Don't be surprised if public recognition comes your way.",
"Some rather disconcerting information may come to light today. This could throw you into a daze, as it isn't anything that you expected. This isn't necessarily bad news, Libra. In fact, it might be great news, but it may be something you never expected in a million years. Work through the shock and try to view it from all sides.",
"You might get a lot of mixed messages from friends, relatives, and colleagues, Libra. They may say one thing while you sense that they mean something else. Insist on hearing how they really feel. This can prevent a lot of resentment later. New businesses could open in your neighborhood that you might want to check out. Take a look - especially if it's a new bookstore.",
"A rush of activity at home is probably going to involve preparations for a journey or event. More than one visitor could arrive during the course of the day. Your mind may be going in several different directions, and this could prove a bit disconcerting. Try to take breaks and remain centered, Libra. You won't accomplish anything if you work yourself into a panic.",
"Today you may take up the study of astrology, numerology, alchemy, or other occult discipline. Your intellectual abilities are particularly sharp, Libra, so you may want to combine them with your tendency toward mysticism. This should keep you busy for much of the day, but you need to watch out for intellectual overload. You don't want to forget what you've learned. Take notes.",
"Libra, making or receiving an important letter or call regarding money might be on your agenda today, but circumstances beyond your control could delay it. This could prove frustrating. Take care of whatever you have to do. Distract yourself if you have to sit and wait. Nothing is worth stressing over. The call will come in time, so just relax.",
"Today your intuition should be sharper than usual, Libra. You might get a few calls involving possible business opportunities. You can use this heightened ESP to discern which ones might be successful. You could also hear from friends proposing participation in a group activity of some kind, which you may want to do. Don't hesitate. Have a great day.",
"A group that shares your interest in an intellectual or spiritual discipline might meet at your home today, Libra. This could be a stimulating event, especially since new members could become good friends. A lot of plans could be made, perhaps for future activities. Fascinating discussions could take place. Don't let the meeting run too late. You will want to unwind before bedtime.",
"You're generally intuitive, Libra, but today you could be so sensitive to others that you pick up on just about everything. Stay away from hospitals or police stations if you can. You might absorb everyone's pain. It's better to put this vibe to work spiritually or artistically. Seek friends and colleagues who work with you in these departments and you should have a wonderful day.",
"Today you might spend a lot of time on the phone with friends, some of them seniors. Your conversations will be loving, informative, and revealing, Libra. As a result, you might decide to attend some group events in your community. A letter, check, or delivery that had been delayed might finally arrive. This is going to release a lot of tension, as you may have feared it had been lost.",
"You're a service-oriented person by nature, Libra, and today the opportunity to spend time serving those in need could well present itself. This could be in a professional capacity or helping someone close who's having troubles of some kind. This particular situation won't last long, but it's likely to change your life in a positive way. Don't resist. Go with the flow.",
"Things may seem surreal today, Libra, so don't take other people's chatter too seriously. This is a day to reach out and touch someone, so pick up the phone. It's a good day to share your dreams, no matter how farfetched they sound. Others may look at you as if you have three heads, but as long as you're being honest with yourself, there's no reason to be shy about sharing.",
"Spiritual or metaphysical concepts you hear about today may seem confusing and bothersome, Libra. You might go off alone to try to make sense of them, but this isn't the day to do that. You will probably only confuse yourself more. Think of this as a good day to collect information, not decide whether to accept any of it or not. Tomorrow your mind will be clearer and more logical.",
"Today you may discover that you have a previously untapped talent for the occult sciences, Libra. This might involve astrology, numerology, alchemy, or using oracles. A class or workshop could be involved. You tend to be intuitive by nature, and studying these fields may offer an opportunity to train that ability to a higher level of accuracy. Find an expert in one of those areas.",
"You consider yourself a rational person, Libra. If you aren't a scientist, you should be. You view life objectively and rarely let extraneous matters cloud your thinking. You're likely to be taken aback by today's extraordinary events. Your intuition is so sharp that you can almost read people's minds. At first you think this is just a fluke, but you may be a believer by the end of the day.",
"There's passion in the air today, Libra. You can feel it. The feeling is so strong that the air almost pulsates. What are you going to do about it? If you're in a romantic relationship, plan an intimate evening together, free of chores and daily tasks. If you're single, peruse your little black book and see if there are any relationships worth warming up.",
"At certain moments you can feel where your destiny lies. Today will be such a moment for you, Libra. You may want to shift your fundamental orientation. Every area of your life will be affected by this shift - where you live, who you live with, your children, and your job. Interesting times lie ahead, Libra. There is no doubt about that.",
"Too many demands placed on you by others could have you feeling used, abused, and stressed, Libra. You might come close to losing your temper. That isn't necessary. All you have to do is learn to say no. It might not be easy, since you tend to want to please everyone, but you have to look out for yourself. Help when the request is urgent and postpone the rest.",
"An enterprise you'd long since given up on, perhaps one involving the creative arts, may suddenly come up again, this time as a real opportunity, Libra. Once you know it's real, you still might have trouble believing that it's finally happening. Friends and your current love interest may accept it more readily than you do. Enjoy your success and make the most of it!",
"Someone who's a little belligerent and abrasive could interrupt the flow of ideas at a class or workshop dedicated to spiritual and metaphysical concepts and values. This won't sit well with you, Libra, but you aren't the type to be confrontational. Don't worry. Let the person have his or her say, then let everyone else debate. Enjoy yourself and learn from all the ideas.",
"If you've considered a career in healing, psychic, or spiritual studies or the creative arts, Libra, today the opportunity to make that dream a reality could come your way. A close friend could open the door for you. Your own psychic and artistic abilities should be operating at a very high level, so don't be intimidated. You're good at what you do and are likely to remain so.",
"Some wonderful new developments could take place in your community, Libra. You might meet some new people who move in nearby. New businesses could also arrive and give a whole new look to the area. You could spend a lot of time visiting others to learn about what's happening. You might also consider fixing up your home, as recent success has made that possible. You will be busy all day.",
"If you've been thinking about studying astrology, Libra, this is the day to do it. Even if you already know the field, you might decide to branch out into a newer or more radical aspect, such as Draconic or galactic astrology. You will learn more quickly and retain more of what you learn, so no matter what interests you, this is the day to put some effort into learning more about it.",
"You could be introduced to a new person today Libra. He or she may be someone who will play a very important role in your life at one point. You will feel an instant connection and find out you share a passion for the same kinds of things. This person could turn out to be a very good friend, and romance is also very likely. Take it slowly and see what happens.",
"Some solid, honest communication between you and those you love is likely to clear up some confusion. Roles are more clearly defined, emotional problems clarified, and chores are more fairly allotted. This is going to make a big difference in your daily life. The removal of relationship issues will guarantee that the atmosphere is more harmonious from now on.",
"Have you wanted to catch up on your reading, Libra? If so, this is definitely a good time to stay home, make yourself some tea, and curl up with a good book. If it's a novel, you will enjoy it thoroughly. If it's nonfiction, you will absorb the information quickly and retain more. If you're into writing, you might want to apply what you learn today to your own project.",
"Paperwork regarding money might take up a lot of your time today, Libra. This can be tedious, but it's something that can make a very positive difference to you, and therefore needs to be handled as soon as possible. Try to stay focused, and don't forget to ask for clarification when you need it. In the evening, celebrate by going out on the town with a group of friends.",
"Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Libra. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.",
"A lot of letters, calls, and other communications could skyrocket you into a new and unexpected space, Libra. If you've been thinking of trying your hand at writing or speaking, this is the day to work on it. All signs indicate good fortune will come your way at this time, though it might sneak up on you and leave you a bit disconcerted. Pull yourself together and go for it.",
"You may be looking forward to an evening with close friends, Libra, probably including a romantic partner. Occasions such as sporting events, movies, or concerts could be on your agenda. Activities involving children are also possible. Don't be surprised if you're inclined to sit quietly and let others do the talking. You might have a lot on your mind and need to let it stew for a while.",
"Today you may feel a lot more energetic after a tiring past few days. When you're feeling good, everything's fine. You're feeling motivated again to get down and tackle the work that's waiting for you. If you have time to make some calls, don't be afraid to look for new prospects, because today promises some very beneficial partnerships in your professional or even spiritual life.",
"At the moment, there's a great deal of electricity in the air, especially in your life at home. Ignore those people who try to provoke you. Don't get involved in conflicts that could degenerate into fights. Go somewhere to be alone. Reenergize by really listening to your desires, feelings, and instincts. Why not spend the afternoon in a museum, for example?",
"At the moment, Libra, the planets are aligned in a way that encourages communication and the written word. Therefore, you may feel like taking the plunge and writing that book you've been thinking about for a long time. It will probably be a great success. You're very gifted when it comes to this kind of creative activity. Go for it and stop making excuses!",
"An older person you're very fond of could visit or call and ask for your advice on practical matters. Clear and logical thinking enhances your intuition, Libra, and you might be able to put this ability to work not only for your friend but also for yourself. Your own interests will be advanced today in some way, so expect a good day.",
"Opportunities to do well-paying creative work could come to your attention today, Libra, perhaps online. You will probably like it, as it may give you freedom. Whether you actually want to try it or not depends on your situation. You might want to get some chores done around the house today in order to leave free time tomorrow for whatever you want to do. Something exciting might happen.",
"Wear the striped shirt and polka-dot pants today, Libra. The more you clash with the outside world the better. You may feel wildly out of place at first, but you will begin to see the beauty, importance, and respect you hold by standing out from the crowd. This attitude change will do you good. You may see a whole new way of living.",
"Overall, this should be a pretty good day for you, Libra, as long as you don't get overly sensitive about certain things. Your awareness is bound to be extra sharp today, so use this ability to stay alert and open to what's going on around you. Perhaps you're feeling a bit restless when it comes to matters of the heart. This is telling you to stop fidgeting and take action.",
"You're probably excited about a forthcoming journey, Libra, but you may be unclear about the arrangements. Don't let this situation persist or your trip might not work out the way you hope. Get in touch with people who know what's what and get as much information as you can. Then you will know it all before you get on that plane.",
"Your warm, sensitive nature is perfectly suited to today's aspects, Libra. Your emotional energy is strongly tied to your heart, and you will find that there's a longing to be close to others. Indulge in conversation with close friends and let your imagination run wild. Your creativity is especially piqued today, so start an art project or write a song that inspires or perhaps changes the world.",
"Emotions could be running high, Libra. Someone in your entourage may have a problem with an authority figure and political issues could come up. You're likely to feel especially powerful now, and so you might be tempted to throw your hat in the ring. It's better to stay out of anything political and channel that power and passion into your own project. That's likelier to bring positive results.",
"Today you might need to run some errands, Libra, but they might prove difficult for a number of reasons. The errands could be personal or business related. Communication may be temporarily blocked. Messages may not be delivered or you could be playing phone tag. On days like this, you need to make a special effort to keep cool. Nothing is so important that you have to drive yourself crazy.",
"A visitor who needs a little sympathy could visit you today. Your friend probably wants some advice about some problems. He or she could also bring information involving new scientific or metaphysical studies that you find fascinating. This information could trigger your own insights. Write down your ideas. You will want to remember them.",
"Some intense, revealing communications with a close friend or lover could reveal wonderful new things about your relationship. Perhaps you have more in common than you thought. Perhaps fears prove groundless. As a result, Libra, the two of you could grow closer and discover a new mutual sense of purpose. Enjoy the positive feelings, and have a great day together.",
"Something is tugging you back down to reality, Libra. Your mind has tended to be in the clouds lately, but now you need to ground your emotions and realize that you operate on a physical plane, too. Your emotions are stable for now, affording you a chance to step back and evaluate how you've been treating yourself. Make sure you give yourself the attention you deserve.",
"Artistic activities or those involving healing are enhanced today, Libra. Whatever you try is going to be more a part of your very being than it would be at other times. Love, art, psychic or spiritual activities - all should take on a new meaning for you at this time. This condition should last for a long time. Make the most of this energy now and your skills should continue to grow.",
"The urge to stay in and rearrange your furniture might hit you today, Libra. You may want to clean out the shelves in your kitchen, add some new knickknacks, or rearrange your books into specific classifications. This may be a lot of work, but it will also be a lot of fun. Get other members of the household to help and turn it into a party.",
"Fanaticism or obsessive thinking may be something you need to look at today, Libra. Common areas for such behaviors are in the pursuit of money, power, success, and romance. There's a fine line between ambition and obsession. If you find that you think of nothing else but one fixation, it may be time to talk with someone about it. He or she may see what you don't want to see.",
"Libra, don't be fooled by others who aren't straight with you. If you don't know the person well, trust your instincts. You tend to care for others, so it can be easy for you to feel sorry for someone and be inclined to help. Make sure that the person you help really deserves it and is telling you the whole story. Taking this extra time can save you problems later.",
"Chances are good that you will receive a helping hand or comfort from someone many years your senior who cares about you, Libra. Don't hesitate to ask for their thoughts, ideas, and assistance. They will probably enjoy being able to do this for you and be glad that you've approached them. Be open and accept the love and support that's offered.",
"Your active side may show through today, Libra. While you can be extremely focused on brainwork, you also love to keep active and do physical work. When you have a project like cleaning your home, you can be very fast and efficient when you want to. This is a good day to get a lot accomplished. Run around doing this and that. You will probably enjoy it very much and feel very satisfied afterward.",
"Are you living your dreams, Libra? Are you still in touch with them? The energy from today's planetary aspects can lend strength and encouragement to this part of your life. Seize the opportunity to take hold of the things that you want most of all. Ask yourself what you want people to say about you after you're gone. Get back on track to a fulfilled life by taking steps toward your desires.",
"Today may be an excellent time to take a second shot at something that didn't work out the first time, Libra. Falling flat on your face can damage your confidence and self-esteem. But failure and rejection are parts of life, and they really do add character. By going back into the ring, you ensure that the character you're adding to is courageous, and through perseverance, successful.",
"The results of the recent planetary influence are coming home to roost, Libra. If everything went according to plan, you gained some insight into your ego. Buddhist wise men say that the path to spiritual fulfillment lies in knowing how to build a healthy ego while developing a part of oneself completely foreign to the ego. Are you working hard at this?",
"Good news involving a small, extra sum of money could come today, Libra. You might receive a check in the mail. Take a friend out to lunch. You will both have fun. Afterward, you may want to blow the rest of the money on something frivolous, but don't go that far. Think about one or more items you want and concentrate on those.",
"The events of the day might leave you feeling a bit confused and bewildered, Libra. Perhaps you're feeling like you aren't getting the attention you feel you deserve. You may wonder why the one thing you want the most may be the one thing you can't have. You have more than you think you do. No one wants to be with someone who's moping and depressed. Let your internal light shine brightly.",
"Recent events in the love and romance department may have you feeling like you aren't getting your needs met, Libra. Remember that other people aren't mind readers the way you are. If someone's behavior isn't right with you, say so. Romantic partnerships should uplift and support your dreams, not something you make personal sacrifices for just to maintain.",
"Today you might toy with the idea of doing some renovation on your home, perhaps for your enjoyment, but primarily to increase its value, Libra. Decorating, landscaping, or both might be on the agenda. A number of possibilities could present themselves, and you will probably spend much time giving each some serious consideration. In the end, you will probably choose the most beautiful!",
"You might have intense dreams and visions tonight that could be almost prophetic, Libra. These premonitions could be personal, but they're apt to be more worldly, such as political events or something in the life of a celebrity you admire. What you sense should be positive, so there are no warnings involved. Write them down so you can verify them later. You might be surprised!",
"The Universe is encouraging you to listen today, Libra. This isn't a day for polemic speeches. It isn't a day to try to win others over to your point of view. Really listen to what your friends, loved ones, colleagues, and neighbors say with all of your attention and empathy. You will strengthen your bonds with everyone and may be surprised at what you learn.",
"It isn't a good idea to blame your troubles on others, Libra. The only one that you really have to blame is you. You will find that your mind is active today and that it might send you around in circles unless you make a conscious effort to slow it down and get it going on the right path. Deal with the facts of the situation instead of the emotions that may arise from it.",
"Treat yourself to something special, Libra, whether a gourmet meal, new outfit, or latest gadget. Today is your day and you shouldn't deprive yourself of anything. There's a remarkable synchronicity of events that will lead you to exactly the right place at the right time. There's a special warmth and sensitivity in the air that will put your mind and emotions at ease.",
"Some rather bizarre news could come to you today about metaphysical or paranormal matters, Libra. This isn't anything that affects you directly, but more likely concerns discoveries of anomalies. You and others could find it fascinating and discuss it for hours. Don't be surprised if the theories that come up seem even more bizarre than what you heard in the first place!",
"Your day could be worrisome and stressful, Libra. Your workload may be especially heavy and you could be putting in some long hours. Relations with others might also be a bit tense. Ease the stress by playing music and take frequent breaks. Have a good meal at lunchtime and then take a walk. Things are likely to be a lot more laid back tomorrow!",
"You may feel a strong urge to run away from it all, Libra, but where would you go? The restlessness you feel may be in response to all the pressures on you now. Social demands, work requirements, and the needs of family may be pulling you to the breaking point. You can turn off your phone for the day. Pull down the blinds, cuddle up with a good book, and pretend that you're all alone.",
"Dreams should shed light on some difficult issues you've been trying to resolve, Libra. You can finally make the problems disappear. This should be more than a relief to you - it's a blessing! Your friends might want to take you out to celebrate, but you will probably want to sit home and enjoy your newfound contentment. Pour some wine, put on some favorite music, and relax! You've earned it!",
"Today you could surprise a close friend or lover with a gift, Libra. There may be no special occasion. You may have seen something in the store that you knew he or she would like or mentioned wanting. You aren't doing this for the sake of appreciation. All the same, you will receive it. Don't play down your own kindness. Just say thanks and smile.",
"A recent windfall or good news regarding money could turn your thoughts to home renovation and decorating. You might do some painting or add decorative touches to the house. Even if you don't have a fortune to spend, fresh flowers, plants, and pillows or area rugs can perk up a room. You might even shop for some new furniture. Have fun with your projects today, Libra!",
"Learning is apt to be your primary concern today, Libra, probably metaphysics, philosophy, history, or some other division of the humanities. You might spend a lot of time in libraries or bookstores or perhaps attend a lecture or workshop. Discussions are likely to follow, and the exchange of ideas will prove stimulating. Take copious notes and enjoy your day.",
"Minor changes in your money situation could make for a beautiful day, Libra. Perhaps you discover a bank error in your favor, get repaid for a loan, or receive a generous gift. Whichever it is, it's likely to make it possible for you to make a purchase you've been thinking you had to postpone for a while. Enjoy your good fortune and make the most of it!",
"Friends who have been traveling or live far away could bring some interesting news your way that hasn't yet broken in your area, Libra. This might make you curious to do some research on the subject. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt until you determine the facts for yourself. Things can get garbled in translation when you hear things second or third hand.",
"Past issues may rear their ugly heads today, Libra. No, it isn't pretty. In fact, it's frustrating to have to deal with this problem again. You will be well served to spend time meditating. You need to address these issues once and for all or they will continue to haunt you. You're fortunate to have such close friends who will support you through this difficult process.",
"It's strange how past incidents can still cause such pain in the present. Today you may feel overwhelmed by memories of a particularly traumatic incident. No one is more surprised than you by your reaction. You felt sure you'd addressed this issue and put it behind you. Apparently there's still work to be done, Libra.",
"Today represents the start of a period of endings and new beginnings in your career, Libra. You might be leaving an old job for a new one or advancing to a new position with your current employer. New technology may play a part in this transition or new knowledge that you've recently acquired, or both. A possible drawback is that stress may affect your energy. Pace yourself.",
"The development of a talent that you've neglected could have surprising results, Libra. You could find that it's just what you need in order to expand your horizons and catapult you into whatever situation you want to be in. This could lead to an increased income. You're changing inside, and these changes are mostly positive. They may also be reflected in your outer life.",
"This is an exciting day for you, Libra. You can accomplish quite a bit. Your intuition is especially acute and your sensitivity is strong. Computers might irritate you today. It's possible to get all worked up if your laptop crashes. Save your work often. Keep in mind that it's just a machine. Don't let it get the better of you.",
"The gas is on, Libra. One spark can cause an explosive fireball. There's a tremendous amount of potential energy to the day just waiting to be unleashed. Know what you're getting into before you light that match. The effects of your actions will ripple for some time. That said, go ahead and set the situation on fire. Perhaps there's an issue brewing that can no longer be ignored.",
"Others' attitudes toward you may seem to be changing. You may not be sure what this means. The fact is, Libra, you're changing, and some of your friends may like what you're becoming and others may feel less comfortable. You can't stop what's happening. It's going to be a very positive process in the long run. It just may be difficult now. Bear with your friends and yourself.",
"Today you may want to spend your free time alone, contemplating various ideas, Libra. Spiritual or metaphysical philosophies from ancient cultures or foreign lands might be more appealing than usual. Reading about them at this time could approach obsession, but this is OK. Whatever you learn today is likely to contribute greatly to your personal growth and perhaps self-expression.",
"This is a fantastic day, Libra. Elements of your life seem to be falling into place. You're in a period when you're beginning new cycles of love and mental activity. These beginning points are highlighted. You should think about how you want to be remembered in the future. Your heart and mind are working harmoniously, so take advantage of this to lay down some plans.",
"If things aren't going smoothly in a romantic relationship, be careful about blaming yourself, Libra. A partnership means that two people work together equally. If this isn't the case, let your partner know how you feel. While the passion may run high between you, the real glue that will hold you together is sincerity, sensitivity, and mutual understanding.",
"You may be acting unconsciously, Libra. Suddenly you're halfway through a task and wondering what you really hoped to accomplish by starting it in the first place. Be more conscious of your energy and how you use it. Make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot by wasting your precious resources on things that don't really matter in the long run.",
"Information received today excites your imagination and encourages you to start a new artistic or creative project, Libra. Stories, pictures, abstract concepts - all could come together in your mind and form an inspired idea that could change your life. Gird your loins, write down your thoughts, and see where it all takes you. You might be surprised by what you produce!",
"Don't get too caught up in the emotional side of life today, Libra. Keep things light and keep them moving. A rolling stone gathers no moss. Unfortunately, you may have quite a bit of that green stuff growing on you now. Get up and get moving. One little bit of effort will send you off and running. Don't hesitate. You're ready to take the plunge.",
"Every day is a new start and new chance, Libra. Don't get upset or angry over past events. Don't dwell on things you can't change. Your whole life can turn around in a day, so start every morning with a positive outlook. As you wash your face in the morning, think of it as a renewal. Clean off the debris from yesterday while welcoming the freshness of a new day.",
"A long-awaited and very welcome call from an older friend might finally come your way today, Libra. News that a goal you've been working toward has finally been reached could come as well. You're optimistic about the future. The ambition that has served you well in the past will continue to do so. You will probably entertain some visitors. It will mean work, but you will have a great time.",
"Today a bubble of confusion clouds your reality, making it difficult to decide what to do next, Libra. Be careful that you don't tie your stomach in knots from the tension created by your mental confusion. Problems with indigestion are likely now because of your worries over what your next step should be. Relax and go with the flow. Things will work out fine.",
"Be careful of letting your heart get carried away today, Libra. Extreme emotions are likely, making you very aware of your environment and what other people are thinking about you. You may want to retreat to the forest and seek council with the fairies and trolls. Fantasy is a terrific way to escape the emotional intensity that's likely to be in the air on a day like this.",
"Today your spiritual and career goals may come together, Libra, enabling you to make a living without compromising your ideals. New opportunities may come your way to make new friends with people who share your beliefs and interests. You might reflect nostalgically on the past and yet look to the future with great optimism. Good luck!",
"You may feel indecisive today, Libra, especially in the morning. Other people's actions may confuse you. Don't worry. Concentrate on your projects and goals. Other people can take care of themselves. Don't feel like you need to make sure everyone is attended to before you start your day. In fact, you may be the one who needs to be cared for by others. Ask for a shoulder to lean on if you need it.",
"Add a bit of spark to your day, Libra. Get yourself into gear. It might feel like there's a great deal of anticipation in the air, but don't get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the day you've been given, and make sure you use every minute to its fullest potential. Small annoyances may turn into large headaches unless you maintain an honest mind and neutral standpoint.",
"Your head may be going in a thousand different directions today, Libra. You may not have much time to stop and think about your next move. Things will come up suddenly and you will need to be able to react quickly. The faster you move, the less time you will have to react. For this reason, you may want to consider a side route where things are flowing a bit more slowly.",
"Social invitations or opportunities to participate in group activities should come your way for a few weeks, Libra. Your phone could ring off the hook. Relations with others should be warm, friendly, and congenial, so any sort of get-together you schedule or attend today should go well and be informative. In the evening, plan a romantic encounter with the special person in your life.",
"Emotional reunions with friends or relatives you haven't seen in a long time could take place today, Libra. Some of these might be unplanned and off the wall. You might meet your sixth-grade teacher at the mall, increasing the feeling of warmth and happiness that you've been enjoying lately. An evening spent relaxing at home with loved ones increases your sense of security.",
"Although things may be going well for you at work, Libra, it's probably taking a physical and emotional toll on you. You may suffer from mild stress-related conditions like headaches. It might be time for a vacation. Even if you're unable to get away in the near future, just thinking about and planning a trip can help. Plan to go to a place where you know you will feel relaxed and have fun!",
"You may have heard a juicy story about a friend lately and be just dying to share it with your entourage, Libra. Be careful with this impulse! The party in question would not appreciate hearing about what you're doing. You could unnecessarily harm someone's reputation. Think about how you would feel if the show was on the other foot!",
"Career matters may be put on hold for a few days, Libra, but your professional future probably won't be far from your thoughts, even in the midst of time spent with family and friends. You want to improve your financial situation, and a number of possibilities have come up. Don't mull them over too much now. You don't want to neglect your loved ones. Relax and enjoy their company today.",
"You have a keen intellect and unparalleled persuasive powers, Libra. If you aren't an attorney, you should be. All signs indicate that your career is about to skyrocket. Career and financial success are pretty much guaranteed with today's planetary configuration. If you have a mate to share this good fortune with, consider yourself doubly blessed.",
"An unethical acquaintance could be spreading unfounded rumors. Don't take anything you hear today at face value, Libra. Get all the facts before drawing conclusions. Equipment being installed or acting up adds to the confusion. If the situation weren't so frustrating, it would be comical. Take deep breaths throughout the day. Tomorrow things will be on a more even keel.",
"You may reminisce today, Libra. Perhaps you're thinking about friends and family who live far away. You could feel a bit nostalgic, not to mention blue, thinking about times long past. Consider making some phone calls to counteract these feelings. If you can't connect with a particular person, spend a little time looking through a photo album to bring him or her closer to you.",
"Expect to receive some great news today, Libra. Answer your phone and check email all day, because you never know when it will come. Indications suggest that success in all aspects of your life is coming. You may complete a project to acclaim or submit a report that's accepted without question. These small successes boost your self-confidence, which brings more success. It's a powerful cycle.",
"Telepathic messages you get from a friend or relative could seem confused and garbled, Libra. This might bother you, especially if the person is normally practical and rational. We all have bad days. Try to observe their behavior and see if there are any warning signs of inner or outer crisis. If not, you may have to just let them be. You can't force another to ask for assistance.",
"You usually don't mind being alone, Libra. In fact, you enjoy your own company. Tonight you're going to crave companionship. You could have an impromptu party in your kitchen, perhaps involving friends who are also business associates. Some fascinating conversations could take place about business and intellectual matters, as well as some deeper subjects that keep you thinking for hours or days.",
"It may be best if you stay out of the line of fire, Libra. Don't get into others' battles. By choosing sides, you create enemies. Use your compassion to soothe the situation. Use your caring nature to put out the fire. Don't get sucked into the flames where you may add to the confusion. Your job is to stand aside. You can care about the outcome without throwing yourself in headfirst.",
"There's great opportunity for romance today, Libra. Love the people you're with, but don't smother them. The more you loosen your grip on a situation, the more you will gain control of it. Cutting chains to the past is the first step in moving forward toward a goal. You might not realize how much a past situation holds you back until you make the effort to release it.",
"Today is a terrific day to let your sensitive, caring nature shine through fully, Libra. Surprise someone with roses and a candlelit dinner. Take care of the amenities like music and wine. It's also an excellent time to go shopping for yourself or others. Let romance lead the way. Your inner core will be fueled by your sensual relations with others.",
"For dreams to be actualized, they must have a vehicle through which they can manifest, Libra. Today is a day to help bring those dreams to life. Use the incredible grounding force to simultaneously expand your mind and bring it down to Earth in a realistic manner. Combine ancient wisdom with practical planning to help set a powerful wave in motion for the future. You have all the tools you need.",
"Working at home could be difficult today, especially if you're finalizing a business deal, Libra. Other household members will be coming and going, slamming doors, asking questions, bringing their friends in. If you're doing household chores, forget it for now and return to it when it's quieter. If you're approaching a deadline, close the door and tell others to leave you alone for a while.",
"This will be a great day to meditate, Libra. You may be a bit dissatisfied with yourself because your various projects have yet to take form. You're impatient, but who wouldn't be? This waiting period has lasted for about two months, but will soon end. The planets ask you to consider only what is essential. Don't allow yourself to start new projects based on anything superfluous.",
"Are you certain that you can't modify your current situation, Libra? Are you a prisoner of a lifestyle that isn't of your own making or that may be a throwback from the past? People have been asking you to take on too many responsibilities and this is what weighs you down. Don't be afraid to be alone and distance yourself from these situations. Learn to say no and make your own life!",
"Some unusual dreams could have unexpected side effects, Libra. They could spark new ideas for creative projects or possible innovative concepts to advance your career or social life. They might clue you in to what's in the hearts and minds of those closest to you. Your dreams might say a lot about you. Write them down so you can analyze them. You might be surprised by what they bring to mind.",
"Some intense communication could take place today between you and a love partner, possibly about your future together, Libra. It's likely to lead to some positive developments in your life, possibly including a move to the next level of commitment. If you aren't involved now, a friend could introduce you to someone new, perhaps at a social gathering. Look your best throughout the day!",
"A family member could be experiencing business difficulties, Libra. Your sensitivity could cause you to feel their anxieties, too. You might want to make it clear to this person that you're there for him or her, but you also need to be objective about the situation. Protect yourself psychically, perhaps by surrounding yourself with white light. It won't help your relative if you're stressed.",
"You have a creative soul, Libra, and today it's working overtime. You can't stop all sorts of imaginative ideas. Even if you've never written fiction, today you will have many clever ideas for stories and screenplays. Jot them down because they aren't likely to stay in your head for long. Refer to them later when you have some time to capture their essence more fully.",
"You need to give yourself more credit, Libra. When you set your mind to something, no matter how ambitious, you usually accomplish it. Remind yourself of this today, as you may feel bogged down and overwhelmed by obligations at work and home. Pay attention to your finances. All signs indicate that you may have inadvertently let a bill or other obligation slip through the cracks.",
"Your imagination should fly high today, Libra. Whether you're into writing, music, or dance, make the most of your creative inspiration. If you don't, your ideas may vanish as soon as they appear. If you're too busy, at least make time to jot down your insights and any possibilities for developing them. Then you will have a record you can return to at a future date.",
"It's time to show other people that you have backbone, Libra. It could be that up until now very few people have noticed, since you're so flexible and adaptable to change. You easily wriggle your way downstream, and as a result, people may think they can control you. Prove to them that this isn't the case by setting your own agenda and sticking to it.",
"The feeling that someone is coming to visit you might be with you throughout the day, Libra. Your intuition is probably right, except for one thing - it's probably more than one person! Some friends may have some good news that they want to share as soon as possible. Straighten up the house and pretend to be surprised when they come to the door. Have a great evening!",
"If you've been planning to spend a day meditating, Libra, this is the day to do it. You're in an elevated frame of mind, not in a space to focus on mundane matters. Artistic inspiration could come to you now. Any kind of exercise should get the endorphins flowing. But don't expect to get any practical work done. You're definitely out of this world.",
"Confusion may reign today as you try to glean some information that seems to be totally elusive, Libra. Are you researching a project? Are some of the facts obscure? For now, it might be better to work on something else and go back to your research in a few days. To keep at it now might involve you in a lot of work for negligible results.",
"You have many talents, Libra. Today's astral energy indicates that your abilities will be rewarded. Congratulations! You've certainly worked long and hard to achieve your goals. Why not make plans to celebrate? Call some friends or your partner for an impromptu get-together. You can meet at the local bistro and bask in the happy energy of success. The first round of drinks is on you!",
"You have a persuasive nature, Libra. Take care that you don't come on too strong today. You may try to rally support for a favored cause of yours. By all means, spread the word, but let others come to you if they're interested. You tend to beat people over the head about doing the \"right\" thing. Don't pressure anyone. If just a few people help, at least they will be truly committed.",
"Consider composing a bit of poetry today, Libra. Use this as an exercise to condense your ocean of emotions into a very few words. You might find that a great deal of your inner turmoil really boils down to just one or two central things. Let your written words express this as succinctly as possible.",
"You may receive a letter or phone call that spurs you into action, Libra. You might realize how close you are to reaching a long-term goal, and harness your energy for that final push to the finish line. Now that the goal is in sight, you're already thinking about what your next one will be. \"Ever onward\" is your motto.",
"You look especially attractive today, Libra, and it's doing wonders for your self-esteem. Even members of your household notice. But you probably feel more like staying in than going out. If you want a romantic partner to notice how you look, it might be a good idea to extend an invitation to visit your home. You will get to stay in and still be admired by the one you love the most!",
"It's likely a hidden talent of yours is revealed today, Libra. All those scraps of writing could turn into something more concrete, such as a novel. Maybe you begin to dabble with your children's paint set and realize how much you enjoy the creative process. Be open to all possibilities. You may find your life takes a different, more authentic direction.",
"What is your dream, Libra? Answer that question as specifically as possible today, then set about attaining that goal. All signs indicate that whatever you begin today will pay off big time. Even though you may feel that your dreams are too ambitious, there's no need to feel overwhelmed. Vow to take things one step at a time. Keep in mind the old adage, \"Once begun is half done.\"",
"You may not be very precise. Your motto seems to be \"everything is relative.\" However, paying attention to details doesn't necessarily mean that you lose sight of the fundamentals. Your friends could tell you that. If you're an artist, you might make an effort today to be clearer in your expression and a little more down to Earth.",
"Your thoughts are leaning toward the past, Libra. You aren't moving backward, but you may want to get in touch with your roots in order to move into the future. You would also like to better understand of the mistakes of the past. You're going to be something of a psychoanalyst today.",
"You're naturally a kind, compassionate person, Libra. Today your feelings are likely to be focused not only on those close to you but also on all the world's population. A feeling of unity with the billions you've never met could overwhelm you now. You might want to write down your impressions so you can refer to them later. You might otherwise forget it all.",
"Some news that comes to you from a friend or colleague could shake you up today, Libra. You might find that what you learn casts doubts on concepts you've embraced for most of your life. This could confuse you. Don't feel threatened. Everyone has to recreate some values from time to time. Think about it when you're more relaxed and you might find it isn't so radical after all.",
"If you have children, their difficulties may remind you of your own, Libra. Or their education brings back memories of your own. Have you held onto any issues from that period that still bother you today? This would be a good time to ask yourself that question. The answer could benefit your loved ones dramatically.",
"A moment will come when you can no longer fight against the current transformation you're going through in your professional life, Libra. The system that you live in will soon put you at a kind of impasse, but this won't necessarily be unpleasant. However, you will be obliged to change paths whether you like it or not. You will probably want to!",
"You're definitely going to appreciate the harmony today, Libra. After the confrontational mood of the past several days, it looks as though you will be able to rest a bit. If you feel somewhat weary, it's for good reason. Today provides a good opportunity to rid yourself of the burdens people are trying to make you carry.",
"This is a day for doubts, for asking those hard questions that you need to answer. If you like to meditate, Libra, think about spending a little more time at it today. You could learn a lot about yourself. You will see the whole palette of human emotion in other people, from joy to disappointment. Where do you fit in?",
"You have a strange and wonderful day ahead, Libra. Once you've finished your work, you may want to either draw or write something that will help you remember today for a long time. You're beginning to see the results of recent changes in you, and you're looking for a way to express them. It may be difficult to find just the right words. But aren't you a natural-born writer?",
"This isn't a good day to go out, Libra. Traffic is probably awful. Don't trust any gossip that comes your way! It's probably passed through at least half a dozen people and retains little, if any, of the facts. Someone might be passing along rumors for their own reasons, so believe nothing you hear without checking it out.",
"Today you might decide to put in some extra hours on the job or take on an extra project of some sort in order to bring in a little more money. Since you're feeling strong and energetic enough to move mountains, Libra, you need to take care not to overexert yourself. Work hard and earn your money, but pace yourself. Try to get a little exercise before going to bed.",
"Strong intuition concerning ways to generate extra income might pop into your head all day. Some of them may seem off the wall, but don't let that stop you. Look into the possibilities. They might not be that outrageous. This is definitely a day to move your interests forward, Libra. You have the energy and motivation to do wonders. Make the most of today!",
"It will be hard to deal with emotional issues that arise. A strong misleading force is feeding the illusion that things are fine when they really aren't. Stop pretending that everything is going well, Libra. The sooner you face the truth, the sooner it will stop plaguing you. Confront the deception directly.",
"You may be in a difficult position, Libra. You want to explode into a new way of life yet feel stuck. Perhaps you feel chained to your current routine. You may feel like you're indeed making progress in the world, but you long for a giant release - like a trap door opening - that allows you to make a leap into the great beyond. This door is always open.",
"Get into the spotlight where you belong instead of letting someone else take credit for something you did, Libra. Don't be shy about strutting your stuff. You may usually turn away from people who act this way because they seem shallow and self-centered. Realize that you're more sensitive. Be proud of who you are.",
"Social events or group activities may prove draining today, as a lot of people might want to take advantage of your talents. Your kind, accommodating nature might cause you to try to make everyone happy, Libra, but this isn't realistic. You might stress yourself to the point of not caring what gets done. Be discriminating about what you commit to doing.",
"The forecast is wonderful today, Libra. You may have been asking yourself a thousand questions about what will become of you, especially in terms of your career. It's as though all your experience so far no longer make sense. The positive aspect of that observation will energize you today. Live for the moment, be in the present, and know that anything is possible in the future.",
"People seem fussy about your way of doing things today, Libra. Try as you might, it seems there's no pleasing the authorities. You, one of the world's great escape artists, would be well advised to choose this opportunity to do a vanishing act. However, if the financial health of your home is at stake, it would be better to stay and face the music.",
"Your intuition is likely to be operating at a very high level today, Libra. This isn't a good day to be around sick or depressed people. You will probably pick up their gloom and it could possibly spoil your day. This is a good day to finish old projects that you may have postponed. Your insights and ingenuity are likelier than usual to give you the motivation you need.",
"You mustn't expect to do whatever you like today, Libra. Quite the contrary! You may be restrained by technical limitations. Perhaps your financial resources will be insufficient. In other words, you won't be able to follow your usual pattern of taking refuge on a spiritual island and quietly contemplating your inner thoughts.",
"Are you hesitating, Libra? Do you feel caught between the desire to participate fully in the world and the equally strong desire to remain in your dream world, even at the risk of feeling a little out of it? Who says that these two worlds are incompatible? If you look closely, you will see that you don't need to choose one or the other.",
"A new wind is blowing in your relationships, Libra, and you probably won't be too sorry about it! The planets are lining up to signal new beginnings. You will be able to take advantage of your recent reflections and test your new self-image. You likely won't be disappointed by the results. Be happy. You have every reason to be!",
"Your level of artistic inspiration is high today, Libra. Dreams or meditation may bring up some spiritual insights and revelations, and you may promptly forget them upon coming out of your dream or meditative state. This could prove frustrating! Try writing them down even if you only remember snatches. This can help bring them to the surface again. You will want a record of them anyway.",
"Romantic passion might motivate you to work on improving your appearance, Libra. You might decide to exercise, change your diet, and experiment with new clothing styles. You're likely to produce the results you want. With the energy and enthusiasm churning within you today, you might surprise yourself with this task or anything else you do.",
"People are apt to be quite emotional when it comes to the image they wish to project today, Libra. Be careful where you step. It's your job to see through the trendy makeup and fashion that hide the true personalities of the people who insist on wearing these masks. The key is to not be fooled by those who hide behind a facade built by society.",
"How irritating to realize that those pesky problems from the past haven't been resolved, Libra! Today you will have the strength and awareness to put these problems to rest simply by talking about them. Ironically, the reproaches made by your partner are what spark the change in attitude that you need.",
"You may be hit with some extreme circumstances that cause you to feel uneasy about continuing along your path, Libra. Use this jolt as a reminder that nothing is set in stone. An element of the unexpected can always creep up on you. Deep down, you probably had a feeling that this difficult situation was bound to happen eventually.",
"Try not to be impatient today, Libra. This could be one day in which you feel restless, and everything seems to take much longer than you'd like. Try your best to go with the flow. Don't get so wrapped up in making sure things happen by a certain time. Quality is more important than speed, and a peaceful mind is more efficient and productive than a stressed one.",
"Why do you find relationships difficult, Libra? You know interactions with others help you learn and grow. This is the case for everyone. But for you, especially, relationships are important because they help keep you grounded. Too often you dream about reality rather than confront it. Today's aspects are going to insist that you make a greater effort with the people closest to you.",
"You're the liquid that takes the shape of its container, Libra. Even though this may seem like the most non-confrontational way to do things, you may find that it's actually a cause of great frustration for you and others. People may be annoyed that you're always following someone else's lead instead of taking the initiative. Try to be more assertive while continuing to be easygoing.",
"If a problem comes your way today, Libra, look for the simplest solution. Not every problem is complicated. Often the most obvious answer is the best one. Try to keep your emotions out of problems that require calculation and thought. They can obscure the view and keep you from seeing what's right in front of you. Draw strength from your common sense. Rule things out by process of elimination.",
"You may be at a high point right now and feeling very excited about things to come, Libra. You probably anticipate but have only a vague notion of what's just over the horizon. You may have a strong desire to rise high so you can see farther. In fact, you probably think that any place is better than your current spot. Have confidence in your future. It looks extremely bright.",
"Are you certain you can't modify your current situation, Libra? Are you a prisoner of a lifestyle that isn't of your own making or is a throwback to the past? People have been asking you to take on too many responsibilities and this is weighing you down. Don't be afraid to distance yourself from these situations. Learn to say no.",
"Your emotions may be playing tricks on you, Libra. You may find it hard to deal with reality. Take the day to relax and unwind. Don't worry about the details. Concentrate more on your general state of mind. Things will go smoothly when you focus on radiating positive energy to others. Don't worry so much about the consequences. Focus more on the process.",
"A quest is in store for you, Libra. You're likely to engage in a search for physical or intellectual space. You may be asking yourself philosophical questions. Or perhaps you're thinking of taking a long trip. Which will it be? Will you read philosophy or go to China? At this point, only the stars know.",
"Your energy may be a bit scattered, Libra. Although your days are jam-packed with activities, you still go to bed every night feeling like you didn't get anything done. It's time to prioritize. Examine all the things you do for others and those you do for yourself. You may be surprised at the imbalance you've created in your world. Use this day to do things for yourself instead of others.",
"Many people may have a great deal to say today, Libra, but you could find that you'd rather sit and listen. Feel free to do so. A lot of what's going around is gossip, so you might not want to get involved at all. This is probably a wise move. Keep your nose clean and simply absorb what you hear. Feel free to filter out anything that doesn't sit right with you.",
"Feel free to take the lazy route today, Libra. Don't lift a finger if you don't have to. It may be hard to get others moving, too. You can prod all you want, but if people don't want to go, they aren't going to go. Your flexible nature might be tested. You may find that you need to adapt to the whims of others rather than the other way around.",
"Unexpected things are on the way and it's best to be emotionally and physically prepared. You may be rather indecisive, but when you do act, your moves manifest in short, powerful bursts. Work to keep your dreams in motion. There are people out there who have the resources you need to be successful. Befriend them and share your goals.",
"People may seem a bit stubborn today. Your powers of adaptation may be put to the test, Libra. The people around you are likely to call on your tender, sympathetic nature. Offer a nurturing ear and strong shoulder for others to cry on. Keep things low key and steady. The more grounded you are, the easier it will be to get along with the energy of today.",
"It may be extremely hard for you to make decisions about anything today, Libra. Don't stress about work or the things you need to get done. With today's aspects, it's a day that shouldn't be filled with sour energy from the past. You experience a rebirth every time you wake up in the morning. Venture forth into new adventures!",
"The intense energy of the day is helping you streamline your projects and solidify your thoughts, Libra. Work to manifest the ideas and dreams that constantly swirl in your head. Today is a great day to bring your mind into focus and get down to the nitty-gritty. Clean up the scraps off your plate and make room for the next gourmet course to be served.",
"Today is an extremely creative day for you, Libra. You should allot time and space to pursuing an artistic goal. You're like a magician who has the power to bring fantasies to life. Spread the magic to others and don't second-guess your incredible healing ability. You have a strong presence that radiates powerfully. Be charitable and generous to others.",
"Don't be shy today, Libra. Express how you feel. The more you share with others, the more they will be encouraged to share themselves with you. Today may be filled with a great many tender moments that are worth documenting in your journal tonight. Your thinking is clear and in line with your deepest and truest emotions. You're the star of the show.",
"You may be indecisive today, Libra. You may not be able to find solutions you can live with. You don't need to finalize anything now. Use this day to lay low and gather data. People may seem rather insensitive and erratic. Go with the flow. You have a great deal of warmth and passion to share. You may find that a strong, unpredictable force is affecting your emotions.",
"Don't wait for an invitation to speak your mind, Libra. No one will ask what you think. Express yourself. You've given other people plenty of time to have their say. It's now time to chime in with your opinion. Don't be an observer. Be an active player and help shape the conversation and the events of the day with your powerful words and thoughts.",
"Your mind is surprisingly clear today, Libra, and your thinking fits in line with what your ego has set out to accomplish. The key for you is to let your emotions speak. Take charge and let yourself go after what you want. While you've spent the last couple days in contemplation, the next few days should be more action oriented.",
"Your general mood is at a peak today, although this mood is slightly off due to indecision on your part, Libra. Don't let this get you down. If you find it hard to make a choice about something, the solution is simple. Put off making the choice until you feel more comfortable about it. If you must make a decision today, go with your instincts.",
"Today will destabilize you, Libra. You're trying to rebuild your life on new foundations. Perhaps should you try to change your point of view. Also, you need to preserve your perception, because it will allow you to adapt to all situations. You need to be fully alert and prepared at all times. Try not to become discouraged.",
"You're an emotional person, Libra. You can easily be destabilized by something you read in the news or see on television. Why are you saddened or hurt by the problems of the world? If you've felt some violence surrounding you lately, you will be happy to know that you can heal your wounds today.",
"You might think you're the most intelligent person in the world. You hover over the notions that bind us. You're transformed into an artist who's able to have great ideas. Remember that geniuses always think big. Today you're one of them. Your ideas could help others.",
"You may need to make some distinct mental adjustments in order to fit in with the energy of the day, Libra. Try to tune into these energies and see what kind of balance they can bring to your life. Be more mindful of your words and don't say things you don't really mean. Be genuine in all your interactions.",
"When it comes to decisions, Libra, do what's best for you today. Don't feel like you need to perform certain tasks just because of guilt over a past situation. Do things because you want to, not because you feel obligated to someone else. The only obligation you have is to you. If it's truly your desire to help someone out, then go for it, but don't sacrifice too much of yourself in the process.",
"Be bold and aggressive today, Libra. Even if this isn't in your nature, dynamic action can be rewarding on a day like this. People will be delighted to hear from you. Your opinion is precious. You have many insights to offer the group. Your adaptable nature will be tested. You may need to make adjustments in order to match other people's way of thinking.",
"Don't wait for someone else to take the lead today, Libra. Take charge. Do what you know is right even though someone else might disagree with you. You know what's best for you and the situation at hand. Be just as strong and bold as anyone else. You have every right to state your opinion. Act on the things you believe in.",
"The more you vacillate, the more valuable time and energy you waste, Libra. Take a decisive stance and be confident about your choice. Give it everything you've got. If it doesn't work out, try a different approach. Don't be paralyzed by indecision. Things are moving too quickly. Take control of your life or someone else will.",
"It's time to get down to work, Libra. At the moment, you can't depend solely on your natural creativity, spontaneity, imagination, and originality to get by. You need to demonstrate a certain amount of pragmatism and self-discipline to reach your goals. This will certainly seem more difficult than it really is. It's time to have faith in attributes other than your intuition.",
"Some strange news concerning friends who live far away could come to you secondhand today, Libra. Attempts to reach the people in question may prove fruitless, at least now. Withhold judgment about what you hear until you talk to your friends, as much of what is passed on to you is likely to be misinformation. Tomorrow you should have better luck reaching them.",
"You could suddenly experience an overwhelming wave of affection for someone you've just met, Libra, perhaps a potential romantic partner. Fantasies of the future could waft in and out of your mind. This should feel wonderful in one sense, yet it could also bring up all your doubts and insecurities. Does this person feel the same way? It's probably a bit premature to worry about that. Take it one day at a time and get to know your friend better.",
"Your intuition could bring you an interesting opportunity to increase your income in an unconventional way. Others may think the idea strange, Libra, but for you it's definitely worth considering. Check all the pros and cons, talk to people in the know, and then give it some serious thought. Whether this is the source or not, an increased level of financial security is strongly indicated now.",
"You may wake up feeling strong and energetic, but as the day wanes, stress could cause you to feel tired and worn out. Be careful, Libra. You could become short-tempered around others. This won't happen if you avoid the temptation to go like a house afire first thing in the morning. Pace yourself and your relations with others should remain excellent throughout the entire day.",
"Today may prove to be one of your busiest in a long time, Libra. The promise of continuing success in your personal and professional goals could find you spending a lot of time on the phone, writing emails, or making a few short trips around the community. You might not be able to reach everyone you need to see. Don't worry. Be persistent and you will reach them eventually.",
"Paperwork, perhaps contracts or other legal documents, might need attention so you can move ahead with your projects, Libra. These projects could involve writing or speaking. Your mind is in just the right space to participate in anything involving communication, so doors of opportunity may open for you in this area. Lift your chin and get going. You will be glad you did.",
"Someone close to you might seem more preoccupied than usual, Libra, and perhaps a bit difficult to deal with. Don't take this personally. It has little, if anything, to do with you. This person has troubles of their own that they don't want to share. You might be feeling a bit tense and jumpy, but again, this is nothing to worry about. Take a walk or work out at the gym.",
"Romance is coming your way as long as you stay levelheaded about the situation. Take care of the daily tasks and then let your heart soar. You have a strong connection to your emotions. Trust your instincts and let your heart take control. Be realistic about your relationships with others, but push the boundaries once they've been established.",
"Your intuition and inspiration could enhance your artistic talents, Libra. A powerful drive to express the stories, pictures, or music in your mind could result in your spending as much of the day as you can jotting down your thoughts and ideas. You might spend most of your free time alone as a result.",
"Get your head out of the clouds, Libra, and come back to Earth for a nice visit. There are some things you need to take care of here. Mundane tasks and routine chores won't be painful after you set your mind on getting them done. You can accomplish a lot today. Just make sure you keep a level head and keep a firm handle on the reality of the situation.",
"You might be called upon to choose between two ways of handling a situation, Libra. The old way suddenly conflicts with the new. Which way are you going to proceed? Don't be thrown off course by fast talk and neon lights just because they grab attention. On the other hand, don't assume that the way that has worked forever is still the best. Use your intuition to choose the best route for you.",
"Your artistic side wants to take to the airwaves in some way, Libra. Perhaps you should consider building a website or becoming a commentator on a local radio show. Your dreams need a vehicle in order to reach their audience. Find the means. You have the ability to inspire a many people. Take this ability seriously and make use of your creative talents.",
"Today is a great day to jump out of bed and get things done, Libra. You may feel indecisive, but don't sweat it. You don't have to make any great commitments. You will do fine jumping around from task to task. Get out into the open and say what's on your mind. Engage in some sort of physical activity that gets you breathing deeply.",
"Your emotions may be a bit erratic. It may be hard for you to focus on anything today, Libra. Things continue to shift from one topic to the next with little resolution. Others aren't apt to be very sympathetic to your feelings, so don't expect it. You will only set yourself up for disappointment. It's a better day to focus on your head rather than your heart.",
"Stop trying to feel everyone else's emotions and focus on yours, Libra. Being empathetic is certainly laudable, but at some point you need to face the music and look in the mirror. Make a clear distinction between your needs and those of others. Express your feelings. Ask for help if you need it. Other people aren't mind readers. They probably have no idea what you're feeling.",
"Reach for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, Libra. It's closer than you think. Indeed, your dreams are completely within your reach. There are forces at work today helping you to achieve your goals. You should be in a positive mood all day, and people will be very responsive to you. Let your fantasies lead the way.",
"Speak up today, Libra. Perhaps no one has heard your point of view in a while. More than likely, it's incredibly important for them to hear it. Just because people don't ask for your opinion doesn't mean that it isn't valid. You have incredible insight that others don't have. Don't assume that they know what you're thinking even though you probably know what they're thinking.",
"You might be unfocused and confused about which way to go, Libra. Your baffled look isn't giving others much confidence in your ability to make a good decision. Don't feel obliged to stay in an unhealthy situation. It may be time to let go and break some ties to things that are no longer working for you. Feel good about extracting yourself from old habits.",
"Get your head out of the clouds, Libra. Nitpicky details you failed to attend to earlier may now come back to haunt you. Don't postpone your work any further. The time to take care of the job is now. Balance your checkbook and do your laundry. Clean your bathtub and go shopping. The more you accomplish today, the better you will feel about yourself tomorrow.",
"Bask in today's warm, loving energy, Libra. Adopt an attitude of gratitude and look to see the beauty in everything around you. This is a day to appreciate what you have, especially the people who love you. Compliment others and let them know how much they mean to you. These words and deeds will have a ripple effect that will bring you a great deal of good fortune.",
"Today you may develop a deeper understanding of what's really important to you, Libra. You may be surprised by what you discover. The material means far less to you than the spiritual. It may have taken you a while to learn this, but now there's no going back. Your possessions feel like dead weight. The mere thought of your family and friends fills your heart with love and light.",
"Indecision may leave you helpless at a crossroads today, Libra. Others may be just as undecided regarding which way to go. At the same time, you may feel pressured to take immediate action, and you're tired of waiting for others to make the first move. Find the answers in simple solutions. There's more than one correct way. Your choice is always the right one if you believe it to be so.",
"Sometimes your daydreaming leads you way out of your body and into a place well beyond time and space, Libra. Your romantic nature wants to escape and never touch back down to the real world. Take a giant step toward that which tickles your fancy. Take the loftier approach and encourage others to share your dreams instead of letting them weigh you down.",
"Your sensitive heart may be touched by anger today, Libra. Don't be afraid of hurting other people's feelings as you express this emotion. You'd be doing yourself and other people a disservice by not revealing the true scope of your emotions. The other parties involved may not have all the facts necessary to make the most educated decision. Aid this process by revealing your perspective.",
"Romantic passion might motivate you to improve your physical appearance, Libra. You might decide to exercise, change your diet, and experiment with new clothes or haircut. You're likely to produce the results you want. With the vast amounts of energy and enthusiasm churning within you today, you might surprise yourself - with this task or anything else you decide to do.",
"There are moments when everyone strongly feels where their destiny lies, Libra, and today will be one of those moments. You may soon want to give your life a fundamentally different orientation that will be valid for several years. It isn't just your profession that will be affected but every domain in your life - where you live, relationships, and children.",
"Indecisiveness may plague you today, Libra. Be careful that you don't avoid doing something simply because you don't know which way to go. To cure your restlessness, you should think about going on a short trip. Travel will most certainly help alleviate any worries about a certain situation. The answer you seek will come more easily.",
"You've been on a wild ride for several months, Libra - all that excitement in your personal life and career! If major changes for the better haven't yet occurred, know that they will. A promotion is in order, most likely accompanied by a raise. Don't act so surprised - you've had this coming for a long time. Celebrate tonight with someone dear to your heart.",
"Issues regarding love and romance may be confusing today, Libra. You should be aware that strong forces are at work to tangle the current situation. Try not to get too discouraged by whatever transpires as a result of this energy. Keep in mind that this, too, shall pass, and things will become clear again. Right now you should just sit back and take things with a grain of salt.",
"You're likely to feel a burst of energy encouraging you to engage with others in fun, creative projects, Libra. Join a group of musicians and rock the night away. It's OK to spend a good part of the day up the clouds. This is where you operate best. There's no need to resist this tendency. If other people become frustrated by your otherworldly attitude, that's their problem and not yours.",
"Put some roots down today, Libra. Concentrate on a creative project that you've had in your head for a while. It's time to follow through. Ideas are great, but implementation is the key to making them work. Consolidate your resources and take the time to make a plan. The more patient you are in plotting your actions today, the more successful you will be in seeing them through to completion.",
"You may find yourself bursting into tears for no apparent reason today, Libra. Seek comfort in sitting by a body of water where you can let your emotions flow. Tension builds as the storm draws near. Once it has passed, however, there is calm as the sunshine pierces the clouds. This time of peace and serenity may seem far off, but it's closer than you think.",
"You may think few people understand you, Libra. Even if you try to explain your thought process and where you are emotionally, it still seems like others are more concerned with themselves. Only you can really understand how you feel. Be your own cheerleader. It isn't necessary for everyone to understand everything about you. An air of mystery is part of what makes you intriguing.",
"Your emotions and fantasies are strongly tied today, Libra. Let your feelings revel in a surreal state. Let your daydreams filter into your decisions. You might feel electricity in the air, so go with it. There's a great deal of creative energy available to you that's extremely potent. This energy has an activating effect that will help you get off the couch.",
"You may be forced to put your thoughts into neat little boxes that can be easily understood and processed, Libra. Your ideas are abstract and don't always make reasonable sense. It's OK to have a bit of mystery about things that rational minds can't explain. Although you may feel like the goal is to arrange things in an orderly way, don't feel like you have to do it.",
"The connection between your thoughts and words is strong today, and communication with others goes especially well, Libra. If there's something important to be said, you won't hesitate to say it, unlike your usual tendency to refrain from speaking to the person who really needs to hear you the most. You're doing people a favor by letting them share your incredible wisdom.",
"You may go in many different directions today, Libra, so try to stay focused. Spend some time by water, even if it's just your bathtub, and reconnect with your true self. The more you integrate your inner nature with your outer demeanor, the more you will attract the people and situations that can help you in your journey.",
"Your adaptable nature will be put to the test today, Libra. Try to go with the flow. Remember that you have a rudder with which to steer. You can float down the river freely, but don't think that this means you have to give up all control. You have the power of choice, so use it. Take an active role in events or you might as well stay in bed.",
"If something doesn't make sense to you, Libra, question it. Be strong and confident. Don't let others take advantage of your sensitive and nurturing personality. Your general tendency is to give more than you receive, but this may leave you feeling depleted. Put an end to this cycle. Be conscious of how you distribute your energy. Do something for yourself.",
"After a few days of moving in slow motion, today you will get back all of your energy, Libra. Your instincts will be excellent and draw you to the people who can help you. It might be an excellent day to write any reports - or even your memoirs. Don't be afraid to grab a pen and paper - you will be wonderfully prolific!",
"You're sensitive, Libra, and impressionable. You may not appreciate the intense atmosphere building, but it may be just what you need to get motivated. Yes, you're about to face a lot of pressure, but you can handle it. No more planning, no more delays, no more staring off into space. Buckle down and get your work done. You can fantasize during your free time.",
"Have you ever thought about writing or working for a company in which you can use your excellent communication skills, Libra? The planetary alignment emphasizes writing and communication. It's time to show the world that you have a gift and that people can count on you to do a great job. Think about the publishing business.",
"Make a plan at the beginning of the day for what you want to accomplish by sundown, Libra. This is a good time to tackle many of the nitpicky tasks that require your attention. Be conscious of the fact that there are time limits and restrictions on some of the things you're working on. Keep on task and try not to get distracted by other people.",
"Listen to the birds today, Libra. They have a song for you, telling you to be happy. Take time to do things that make you feel good. Connect with creative people and projects that get your artistic juices flowing. Keep things light and uplifting. It may be hard to make a decision about anything right now, but don't let that keep you from being productive.",
"Sudden psychic insights that seem important could come your way today, Libra, but you could be confused about their meaning. This might bother you today unless you write your thoughts down. Sometimes the process of recording your ideas can bring an insight's meaning to light. If this doesn't help, keep your notes until tomorrow. Things should become clearer then.",
"A friend or colleague may pay you back a small sum of money that's owed to you, Libra. You'll be thrilled, but you might feel a little guilty that you plan to spend it on something frivolous instead of putting it toward your bills. This isn't worth the guilt. It isn't that much money, and you're entitled to a little frivolity now and then. Go for it!",
"Money worries could have your nerves on edge, Libra. It's better to focus on doing what you have to do to resolve your difficulties than it is to waste time fretting over them. Your business head is operating at a high level today. If you stay focused, you can accomplish wonders. Formulate a plan of action and put it to work.",
"Your imagination is always fertile, but today it's especially productive, perhaps surprisingly so, Libra. You could come up with ideas for all kinds of new projects. Friends could want to work with you, and they should have a lot to contribute. Make sure you write down some of your ideas so you can go back to them later. You won't be able to get everything done today!",
"Emotions could be running high today, Libra. Someone in your entourage may have a problem with an authority figure, and political issues could come up. You may feel powerful right now and tempted to throw your hat into the ring. However, it's best to stay out of anything political and channel that power and passion into your own project. That's far more likely to bring positive results.",
"You may feel neglected and unloved today, Libra. If you're single, you may feel worse. Cheer up. If you're running around with such a depressed and dramatic expression on your face, nobody will feel like asking you out. Try to make yourself happy by doing things you like to do. If you smile, you'll be a magnet for someone who has love to give.",
"A member of your household could be depressed over their job, Libra. Something may have gone wrong that wasn't their fault. You might be called upon to distract this person and get him or her going again. You won't be alone in this. More than one visitor could drop by to bring good news and information, thereby improving the mood. You'll enjoy this, too!",
"You may wake up to a cloudy brain fog, Libra. Emotionally, you may find it hard to make decisions about anything even though you're feeling called to do so. There are so many choices and you want them all. The good news is that you should feel much more clearheaded and stable by evening. Hang in there.",
"A group you're affiliated with could meet somewhere in your neighborhood, Libra. Though you're usually more sensitive and intuitive than others, today you could be feeling especially so. Expect a lot of phone calls and visitors. Don't be surprised if you can read their minds! Artistic and creative interests could also be important to you now.",
"The warm, loving feeling that you've been happily nurturing is calling for a bit of practicality in order to make your romantic life work out the way you want it to. Remember that less is more, Libra. Having love and romance in your life doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be best friends with every person you meet. This is a good time to enjoy more quality time with fewer people.",
"You may feel like it's your responsibility to take care of everyone, Libra. If you love someone, your brain translates this into thinking that you need to be the caretaker. If you don't take someone under your wing, maybe you see yourself as selfish or unkind. Dismiss this notion. Other people's feelings aren't your responsibility. Don't let another's well-being become your project.",
"Obsessive thinking may be something you need to look at today, Libra. Common areas for such behaviors are in the pursuit of money, power, success, and romance. There's a fine line between determination and obsession. If you fixate on the same thing day after day, it may be time to talk with someone about it. An expert can help you see what you don't want to see.",
"Libra, try not to be fooled by others. If you don't know a person well and you aren't sure about him or her, trust your instincts. You tend to care about others, so it can be easy for you to feel sorry for someone and bend over backward to help. Make sure that the person you help really deserves it and you know the whole story. This can save you problems down the road.",
"Your adaptive powers are useful in that they give you a high tolerance for uncomfortable situations, Libra. At times, however, this trait may not serve you very effectively. You may end up staying in a difficult relationship or unsatisfying job because you fear something new. Life is short. If you want to improve your situation, take responsibility for it. Be proactive.",
"Music can soothe the savage beast, Libra. If you feel rather savage yourself, turn on some music. Dance and sing aloud. You'll be amazed at how this reduces stress and increases energy. Many find it therapeutic when times are tough and emotions run high. Try it for yourself. Expand your listening range to include many musical styles. You'll be glad you did!",
"Someone you're very fond of could be in a difficult mood today. Don't let your sensitivity get the better of you, Libra. Don't take offense at what this person may say in frustration. Intuit what they're feeling and be your usual compassionate self. This could strengthen your relationship and make you feel good, too.",
"Chatting with your loved ones may be more appealing to you today than any other day, Libra. It may be important to curb this desire if there are many things that need your attention. If you're at home, don't spend all your time on the phone or loafing. Consider tending first to things that need to get done. Socializing will be far more enjoyable without guilty feelings about what you should be doing.",
"You probably have a knack for listening to other people and noticing when they need help or a shoulder to cry on, Libra. Today may be excellent for you to help another person out. Consider going the extra mile by lending a hand to those around you who are in need. Show your extraordinary caring ability and be a true friend. Make someone smile.",
"You may have been exercising too enthusiastically over the past few days, Libra, and today you might wake up with more than your share of muscle aches and pains. You should keep exercising, but tone it down. Forget jogging and aerobics. Go for a little yoga or tai chi, which will enhance fitness with minimal strain. If you can, soak in a warm tub later.",
"Be a bit selfish today, Libra. You have every right to look out for number one. Sensitivity to other people's emotions and issues is noble, but it may leave you emotionally drained. Think rationally about your emotions and have the courage to say no to people once in a while. You're a giver and a saint. This is the perfect day to do some giving back - to yourself.",
"A debate over a controversial subject involving politics or social issues could take place today, Libra. You might find the subject fascinating and learn a lot, but you'll be less comfortable when the conversation changes from a discussion to a quarrel. At that point, you may want to walk away. You're too sensitive, so don't worry about being rude.",
"Too many demands upon you could have you feeling a bit on edge today. If possible, this is a good day to get away by yourself for a while, Libra, as you might feel a strong need to get your head together. It's a great day to go for a workout or get out in the open if weather permits. Take a book with you and gather your thoughts.",
"This isn't a day to sit around and wait for good fortune to come to you, Libra. It's time to make it happen. Get off the couch and get moving. Now that you've internalized, contemplated, and received information, it's time to direct that energy and wisdom outward. Express your creative, artistic self in any way you can.",
"Today you should take action in areas where you usually keep quiet, Libra. The more you explore your mind, the safer you'll feel in your external reality. Be confident of your dreams. This is a day to connect with others about the things that feel most pleasurable. Indulge and enjoy. Take action. You have everything you need to make it all start working for you.",
"Today you might spend a lot of time looking for a lost object, Libra. This item may only have sentimental value. Still, it's important to you that you find it. This isn't a good day to search. You're in a rather frenzied state and could look right at it without seeing it. Wait until tomorrow to look. What you seek is probably nearby and just hidden in some way.",
"Change is good, but it can be scary when it comes suddenly. That's what you feel today when someone announces a major change without warning. You're not sure how to react to the news and haven't a clue how it affects you. All you can do now is wait. Try not to panic. In the end, you'll see that these changes will benefit everyone, including you!",
"You're ready for a change, Libra, there's no doubt about it. As you grow older your interests broaden, and you're considering pursuing some of these new interests in earnest. Perhaps school beckons, or some adult education courses. You're ready to make a new place for yourself in the world. Go ahead and get started!",
"Today you might be trying to do some in-depth research, Libra, but don't be surprised if what you're looking for proves difficult to find. You could get sidetracked by other interesting subjects related to what you're doing. Don't be upset with yourself. Finding what you need won't be easy. Enjoy the side roads and go back to your search tomorrow.",
"You generally tend to be intuitive, Libra, but today your sensitivity might approach the level of an oracle - or seem to! You might have some good luck picking up the thoughts and feelings of others, but your premonitions, while plentiful, are off track. Write them down and check them out later, but don't put any stock in them, at least not now.",
"Daydreams and fantasies about faraway lands and exotic places might have you thinking about dropping everything and taking off for a while. You aren't usually impulsive, Libra, but today you feel restless. If you have no obligations, and if weather permits, go someplace where you can experience a change of scenery. We all need it from time to time.",
"You'll be pulled in many directions today, Libra. It could be like you're in a candy shop with only a dollar and everything looks delicious. Be careful of starting off in too many directions at once and not following through on any of them. If you're stuck and unsure which way to turn, retreat from the situation and spend some time by yourself. You work best alone.",
"The study of astrology and psychic disciplines might be your primary focus today, Libra. You might even take a class in whatever subject interests you. You can also expect to meet some intriguing new people who may be a bit weird but nonetheless could become close friends. If it isn't too dangerous, walk home after class. You'll need to clear your head so you can sleep.",
"Your warmth, sensitivity, and understanding in your relations with those you care about are heightened, Libra. You should feel especially well, as your health is good. You want to get out and be social with friends and family. If there are no outings planned, don't hesitate to be the instigator. Everyone will have a wonderful time, and your company will be greatly enjoyed.",
"You may meet some new people in the next few days, Libra. Someone in your professional life may help you launch some unusual experiments that have never been done before. Or someone may want to create a new service or get into a completely new market. You will be the one they seek to explore these exciting new avenues!",
"You're the sensitive one in a sea of anger today, Libra, so keep your guard up. Don't be tempted or seduced by any rage around you. Be wary of people who seem motivated by fear. You'll be much better off when you align yourself with those who act from a point of neutrality and self-confidence. Model your behavior after the people you see as superheroes in your world.",
"Your mind is like a fine sieve that filters even the smallest details from the whole, Libra. Nothing escapes your attention today. You're right on top of the situation whether people realize it or not. Feel free to take your time and be patient. Facts may reveal themselves slowly, so don't make a major decision about something until you have all the relevant data.",
"An unexpected visit from a friend you haven't seen for a while could bring up long-forgotten memories. You could confront hidden psychological and emotional issues. Though it may be tempting, don't try to repress them again. It's important that you face and release these points. Today you should greatly enjoy seeing your friend again.",
"Romance with someone from far away who shares your spiritual inclinations could arise today. This could be a very intense, loving, and supportive relationship. Don't be shy, and don't let your insecurities get the better of you. There's never any guarantee that a love relationship will last, but don't hold off because of that. Get to know this person.",
"Your values might be under attack. Perhaps someone connected with your job is doing things that seem unethical and you don't want to be associated with him or her. Whatever the situation, dealing with it may be too difficult. You might even consider leaving your field. Think carefully first! Whatever you decide, you'll want to be sure that it's right for you.",
"Forcefulness may not be a usual part of your nature, but if there is a day in which you feel comfortable throwing your weight around, today is it. Enough is enough. Take control of your actions and responsibility for the consequences. Use this day to build your confidence and act assuredly in all your dealings. You either want it or you don't.",
"A social event in your neighborhood, perhaps in your home, could bring practical information your way that you can put to use to advance your business. You could meet some valuable contacts. Information received from neighbors can prove enlightening. You should feel optimistic, enthusiastic, and motivated. Whatever you start now should bring success and good fortune your way.",
"Discussions of spiritual or psychic matters could result from exposure to an author on such subjects. You might attend a lecture by this person or perhaps see a documentary on the topic. You might not be convinced about what this person has to say and want to check it out with research of your own. But isn't that the point - to get you to learn on your own?",
"At first you may be taken aback by someone's aggressive approach to people and situations, but then you may see that really, this person has something important you can learn from. Study this way of going about things and realize that you need to adopt more of this assertive manner in order to be successful. This is especially true in matters of love and romance.",
"Lessons may come in odd shapes and sizes today, so don't feel like you need to make immediate sense of every little thing. Instead of overanalyzing everything and becoming paralyzed by the emotions you feel, take decisive action and make mistakes. This is where the lessons come in. Let them teach you what you need to know.",
"Get off the couch and get into action. Come out of hiding and let others hear what you have to say. Let your emotions shine and don't be concerned about what others think. Dance like no one's watching. Passion will be the key to manifesting your dreams. This is a great day to act bravely toward those dreams.",
"Unusual dreams, visions, and audio phenomena may come to you today. You might think you're hearing voices. Before jumping to conclusions, rule out any logical conditions. You're not crazy. This probably indicates a growing psychic awareness. You should write down what you see, hear, or learn during this time. It could be valuable.",
"Your heart may be hurt by misfortunes that have befallen you. Thinking about times past is just pulling up buckets of tears from a well. Don't keep doing this to yourself. It's time to move forward. Your heart is eager to start something new and bring adventure into your life. Use your emotions as fuel for the future instead of restraints from the past.",
"A lot of interesting letters and calls could come your way today. Or you might have business to transact, perhaps involving paperwork, and spend a lot of time out in the community running errands. Group activities could also take place in your neighborhood, bringing you and your friends closer together. The only caution is that you shouldn't try to do too much.",
"Take charge of your life. Initiate action and major change in an important area. Large trends are being activated today, alerting you to the fact that there's a great opportunity at hand. Take note of any sudden energy and unexpected events. Chaos and confusion may be the initial result, but change is a key ingredient for your future growth.",
"Today an opportunity may come your way that causes you to consider changing your career. No matter what you've been involved with up to now, education could attract you, perhaps involving metaphysical or philosophical subjects. Is transforming your working life the right thing to do now? Only you know. Bear in mind that this opportunity may be a gift from the Universe. Follow your heart.",
"Today you could be in the public eye in some way. Perhaps you're teaching a class, giving a lecture, or leading a discussion group. Whatever it is, don't be surprised if you alternate between inspired and free-flowing articulation and total mental block. When the latter happens, ask for questions. That'll give them a chance to speak and get your brain going again.",
"Your household could be a happy place tonight. Good food and lively conversation heighten the atmosphere as visitors and family members enjoy each other's company. The only downside is that one of your gregarious friends may be feeling rather quiet tonight, listening when he or she is usually talking. Still, everyone's having fun, even if it's in a quieter way.",
"Your partner may be worried because a family member is ill. This could cause your friend to be distracted. If this is a love partner, offer sympathy, but don't expect any gratitude now. If this is a business partner, you may have to take on a heavier workload over the next week. The family member will recover, but your partner won't be much good to anyone until then.",
"You don't want to sit still for a minute. You may make people dizzy with your energy, and you're itching to get away. You may be contemplating a long trip abroad. It's fine to fantasize about all the choices out there, but don't commit to anything today. Your imagination and spirit are a bit too high to settle on anything in particular. Just enjoy all the choices for now.",
"Take care that you don't exhaust yourself. You could be doing too much for others right now. Your kind heart and generous nature often have you saying yes to requests when you should be refusing. Today you might want to rethink any obligations. Think of it this way - you're not saying no to someone else, you're saying yes to yourself!",
"Today you could meet with a female acquaintance that you know through a group. By the end of the day, this person could turn from casual acquaintance to firm friend. You'll find that this woman is not only a warm and kindhearted person but also that your backgrounds and interests dovetail closely. The only caution is that this person is tough where business is concerned!",
"Today could be a strange day as you find it increasingly difficult to concentrate. This is unlike you. You're usually efficient and levelheaded. Blame it on the planets. Their configuration is the cause of the lethargy and ennui. Accept the fact that you won't be moving at your usual pace. You can make up for lost time tomorrow.",
"Your intuition is quite high right now, enabling you to accurately tune in to others' hopes and dreams. This can be a bit tricky in a social situation, however. Someone could be saying one thing when you know they're thinking something else! Don't dwell on other people's thoughts too much. Instead, direct your thoughts to how happy you are now.",
"This is bound to be an interesting day as you meet some new people who have fascinating ideas about esoteric subjects. Listen closely and later jot notes on the conversation. Don't be surprised if you get some good news about advancing in your professional field. It looks as though a raise or promotion is coming.",
"There's an inspirational quality about you today that you should make more public. Instead of shrinking into your imagination, you should expand your energy outward to the people around you. Your heart is caring and sensitive. It's time to earn some public recognition for its loyalty and loving nature. Stand up and take a bow for all the incredible things you do for others.",
"The current aspects indicate success. This might relate to your romantic life or to a creative project that you've been working on for a long time. Whichever it is, it comes at just the perfect time when your enthusiasm and optimism are at a peak. You'll be able to make the most of the fortunate event that comes your way.",
"Your mind may be playing tricks on you, so it isn't necessarily in your best interests to trust your perceptions completely. Consider other methods of solving problems that confront you. If you have fun with a situation, the solution will find its way into your hands easily. You shouldn't have to work especially hard to make things happen for you today.",
"Today you have a quick intellect and intensified persuasive powers. Acute mental powers are joined with personal power to bring about career and financial success. Any projects you start or complete today are destined for success followed by public recognition of some kind. This is a great omen for your future.",
"Confusion about metaphysical or spiritual matters could have you seeking clarity through research. Talking with friends could prove beneficial, but it's important to remember that they could be as perplexed as you. Interesting discussions and technology will make a difference. A friend may prove untrustworthy, so be careful about the people you share confidences with now.",
"You're thinking about friends and family members who live far away and wondering what they're doing. You could feel a little nostalgic, longing for times long past. Don't dwell on it. Call your friends. They'll be glad to hear from you and you'll feel more positive about the day. In the evening, give some attention to those you love who live nearby.",
"Special information that comes to you either from within - your intuitive insights - or without - information received from books, TV, or the Internet - could pave the way for career advancement and financial gain. The outlook for you is rosy, although you can expect a lot of work before you get where you want to be. A stimulating evening with friends or romantic partner is in the works.",
"Just when you slow down, simplify, and plan, things start to pick up again. Your imagination starts to fly. Stabilization hinders your creative spirit. The last thing your artistic mind wants to do is slow down. Resolving this inner conflict may be hard, but it's possible. These two sides are on the same team, not opposing ones. If they work together, you can both achieve both goals.",
"You feel emotionally strong, even though certain people may be getting in the way of your plans. You can accomplish a great deal. You're only responsible for yourself. You feel a drive to work harder than usual. Even though you may be working very hard, your general mindset is good. You should enjoy your day regardless of the circumstances.",
"To understand the shift occurring today, you must look at events from a lofty perspective. A slow liberation process is gathering momentum. Over the next few months you won't refuse an opportunity to rid yourself of an oppressive part of your past. You'll shed your old complexes and emerge renewed. Don't be alarmed if family relations suffer a bit. The distress is only temporary.",
"Business acquaintances could visit you today. They might stay longer than expected, but this is positive. You'll have a lot of interesting discussions that open up doors to more promising enterprises and ways to make a success of them. If you get distracted and talk about other things, what does it matter? Relax and enjoy yourself.",
"Your phone may not stop ringing today. Friends and family may have good news and interesting information to share, so you'll want to spend a lot of time talking with them. You might learn about some newly released books that interest you. A number of errands might also need to be done, but you'll have fun doing them.",
"Hurry up and wait is today's phrase. A visit from a close friend, love partner, or colleague might be delayed, perhaps because of something regarding money or possibly the arts. It keeps you trapped waiting, unable to go anywhere. At times like this, it's best to distract yourself. Find something to do that engrosses you and the time will go by more quickly.",
"A wedding could take place. It might be yours or it could be that of someone close to you. Whoever is getting married is very happy. If it isn't you, you'll be happy for him or her and you might start thinking longingly of a celebration of your own. If you're currently involved but not married, expect to move to the next level of commitment. If you're already married, enjoy the party!",
"You can interpret the day ahead as an open-ended question about you. You may have noticed certain physical or psychological aspects that you're uncomfortable with.

"The possibility of impending changes in your personal or professional life could have you feeling worried and insecure. Don't be. If anything, you'll benefit from these changes. There could be a lot of tension and stress in the air, and it will be hard to avoid picking up on this energy. Try to relax! Let yourself be carried along by the current.",
"You can add more tools to your toolbox today. Express your concerns and you'll find helpful remedies present themselves. Keep the lines of communication open and let the information flow. There's a great expansiveness that comes when you think for yourself - and think big. Don't get bogged down with the emotional side of things. Concern yourself with the facts.",
"The center of your power might find it difficult to commit to anything today. Issues regarding love and romance could arise, and you may feel the need to start something moving in this department. You may be indecisive about which way to go. Spruce up and get out in the social arena. You can let someone else take the lead from there.",
"There's an incredible activation urging you to take hold. You may have many different projects brewing and be unsure where to focus your energy. Don't feel like you need to make a decision now. Go with the flow, but don't lose control. It's important to maintain control while events unfold around you. Be flexible and adaptable.",
"Insights that well up from deep within you could put your imagination into overdrive. Perhaps ideas for essays, poems, paintings, or music flow into your mind in waves. You may want to stay home to develop them, though you may take one friend, or perhaps your partner, into your confidence. Keep the ideas coming! They might mean more to you later.",
"You might walk around in a romantic, imaginative, spiritual fog with your head in the clouds. Everything may seem perfect and wonderful - perhaps too wonderful to be true. Working with equipment of some kind, perhaps computers or other electronics could help you hang on to reality. You might take this opportunity to train in computer graphics or sound engineering.",
"You may be faced with a choice between two different realities. Friends and family are choosing sides while you remain on the fence. You're able to understand both sides of the issue, making it difficult to put your energy in only one camp. Perhaps you wish to serve as a bridge between the two camps. Things don't have to be as black and white as others see them.",
"Good news may come today. Whatever it is should make you very happy and cause you to be too hyper to sit still. You'll probably want to take a quick walk around the neighborhood to work off some of the energy. This could put you in an optimistic space, looking forward to the future. Enjoy your evening.",
"You're apt to feel support, though it might be hidden in unexpected places. Don't discount anyone. Even the most caustic remarks have a touch of sensitivity and progressive thought that can help you a great deal. There's strength in emotional truth even if you don't want to hear it. Bitter pills may be hard to swallow, but they can be good for you.",
"There's a unique combination of energies in the air urging you to combine your psychic powers with your ability to organize. Your business sense is keen, and you understand people and their general tendencies. You instinctively know motives behind actions, so use this to your advantage to make things work effectively for you.",
"You have a flexible nature. Other people may be just as malleable as you, but now is your chance to take the lead. You're at the starting line waiting for the race to start. Don't wait for others to take the first step so you know it's safe to go. Keep your ears and eyes tuned in. As soon as you hear, \"Go,\" start running as fast as you can.",
"You've had recent success in your profession. You've worked hard and learned things, and this hasn't been lost on those above you in the hierarchy. You have earned new respect for yourself and your skills. You might want to put one of your gifts to work. This could be an artistic talent or the gift of healing. Make the most of it!",
"Idealism and some intriguing mystical revelations could make you want to spread your ideas. You may want to invite some friends over to talk.

"Today you might experience a rush of spiritual insights. Whatever comes to you seems clear and right, and it could inspire music, poetry, or painting. The only problem might be that these insights may disappear if you don't write them down right away. Visions from the other side can be ephemeral. If you like what's coming to you, keep a record of it. You'll be glad you did.",
"Letters and calls pertaining to your long-term goals or those of a group you're affiliated with could take up a lot of your time today. You might have to deal with paperwork at some point, and you might not understand some of it. Ask for help if you need it. You might not be familiar with the material, and the matters involved are too important to take a chance on getting it wrong.",
"The time has come for you to take charge in matters of love and romance. This isn't often the case for you who normally like to let others take the lead in this department. A new phase has begun in your love life. You should think about expanding outward into new realms with new people and new circumstances, or both. It's time you were in charge.",
"Movies that involve a lot of special effects might be especially appealing to you now. You may decide to learn more about how such effects are produced.

"Although you occasionally want to spend a whole day alone, this isn't the time. You have a lot of specific goals in mind that you want to take care of today, perhaps involving writing or speaking. There won't be any question of putting them off. This is a great time to start almost any kind of project. The planets indicate success at whatever you try.",

"Today you may feel like going into your past. One half of you feels nostalgia for the \"good old days.\" The other half lives for the future and is unafraid to project into the unknown. Even though this sounds a bit contradictory, both these sides of you help the world move forward. Think about this today.",
"You're feeling conflicting emotions today. It's possible that you enjoy your activities but feel that you aren't good enough to stick with one in particular. What you have is a confidence problem, not a competence problem. You may have an experience today that shows you just how competent and intelligent you are. Seize any opportunity presented to you!",
"Your emotions may cloud your intuition today. You might not pick up on the thoughts and feelings of others the way you normally do, and you could feel at a disadvantage. This is only a temporary condition. Today you'll just have to rely on logic. This could be helpful in the end. Intuition is at its most useful when it's combined with intellect.",
"You're in a spiritual state of mind today. Your dreams are vivid and you're sure they're trying to tell you something specific. It's hard to dispel the urge to travel. In particular, you're drawn to someplace where you can study a different culture. Such a trip might not be practical now, but you can manage some online research on the subject!",
"Creative ideas may elude you today. You may have a hankering to do something artistic but with only a few vague notions, and you may not like those. This is a good day to work with others' ideas. Read, play music by a great composer, copy a painting by a master. This way you'll keep the impulses going without trying to force new ideas that won't come.",
"As much as you want to change your financial situation, don't act rashly.

If you feel in a hurry to make progress, you can record your options so you have them to review in the light of a clearer day.",
"You'll enjoy the gentleness and relaxation today offers. You'll be more talkative than usual. This interlude will give you an opportunity to refresh yourself by spending some quality time with family. You have strong intuition. Listen to it, as it will advise you wisely.",
"Unexpected people, especially women, will surprise you with what they say. Your mother may bring up an issue that you hadn't even considered. Perhaps your emotions get stirred when you recall something that a significant woman in your life said. Your feelings are bouncing from your heart to your head and back again. Take the feelings into account, but don't let them dominate your decisions.",
"This is a terrific day in which you'll be able to cut through the falsehoods and get to the essence of the issue. Don't waste your time on superficial conversations and situations. Your energy is too valuable to spend on those who can't see the deeper meaning. Meditation, intense conversation, and passionate love are in store today. Embrace the sensual, sensitive being within.",
"Friends or groups could make excessive demands on your time today. As a generous and service-oriented person, you tend to go along with what others want. This is OK, but you're not serving anyone by letting them step over the line. You can also delegate. Keep busy, but don't overextend yourself. You need to save some energy for tomorrow.",
"You're a spiritually inclined person, but today your mind is on other planes. Insights and revelations could come thick and fast, and you might want to express them through art. Romantic and other relationships take on a new karmic aura. Meditation could help you make sense of it all, as could a process like past-life regression or rebirthing. In the absence of that, write down your thoughts.",
"A neighbor might be having a hard time and need some extra support now. A new business could open up in your neighborhood that in some way opens doors for you. It could be a new employment opportunity or it could mean a more efficient way of operating in your current profession. Don't be surprised if you spend a lot of time driving around today.",
"You may be in a quagmire of indecision. Your brain is turning in many directions but not coming to any conclusion. Work with this energy rather than become frustrated by it. Feel free to examine every idea thoroughly. By the time you really have to make a decision, you'll know what you want. For now, you're better off experimenting.",
"You might feel like you have more energy today than you usually do. Whether the tasks ahead require physical strength or mental acuity, approach them with confidence. Things come easily and readily, and you can accomplish a great deal. Take a little of this energized time for socializing with a friend or engaging in your favorite hobbies. There's no need to direct it all into serious matters.",
"You may be scolded for something you failed to take care of properly. There's a wonderfully expansive feeling to the day that you should capitalize on. Don't get too bogged down with the little things. Don't get overwhelmed with what you did wrong. There are so many more wonderful things to celebrate. Why spoil them with nitpicky details?"]
