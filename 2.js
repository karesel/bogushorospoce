exports.arr = ["Let your true personality shine, Taurus, for this is your day to radiate. There's an element of fantasy and deception working in the equation, but you will find that this may be just the thing you're looking for. The missing piece may come from a place you least expect, but be confident that it will come. Be open to new ideas and information, regardless of how odd they seem.",
"Two different sides may tug on you today, and neither one may really make a strong case for pulling you one way or the other, Taurus. Realize that adjustments may have to be made for you to fit in with the scheme of things and fulfill your duties and responsibilities. A close loved one may distract you in subtle ways, so try not to get sidetracked if you can help it.",
"Today is a great day to let your artistic nature shine through, Taurus. Your sense of color and pattern is right on target and your words are more poetic than usual. Create a time and space for your creative inner nature to manifest on the physical plane. Let your fantasy world spill onto a piece of paper for others to see. You have tremendous gifts. Feel free to share them with the world.",
"There's a sober feeling to the day that may leave you feeling a bit down, Taurus. There may not be any specific instance or situation that causes you to feel this way, so don't sweat it. Focus on getting your projects done. This isn't the best day to look for sympathy from others. Crank up your stereo as loud as you can and indulge in a scrumptious meal.",
"Things are moving your way, Taurus. As the day progresses, you will find that the energy intensifies. Conflicts may arise near sundown, but don't worry about it too much. See it as a call to jump-start your motor. Visit an antique shop and chat with the people around you. Simple yet meaningful encounters may prove richly rewarding.",
"Relations with family or other members of your household should be especially warm now. Mutual goals and shared wins and losses are likely to bring you closer. Communication with friends and other acquaintances should be open and honest without being blunt, Taurus, providing you with a rewarding day. You probably won't spend much of your day alone. Make the most of it.",
"Spiritual concerns are a bigger issue for you today, Taurus. You may have found that you're drawn to a fanciful mindset and unorthodox way of viewing the world. Pursue this realm of thought and trust that your intuition knows exactly where to take you. Emotional tension may run high, so try not to get down on other people's \"me first\" attitude.",
"Emotions that run very deep should bring you a lot of satisfaction today, Taurus. Relationships of all kinds could also be especially promising. A romantic relationship may be consummated, revitalized, or moved to the next level of commitment. Close friendships might become closer because of your mutual interests. Happiness and satisfaction should reign in the home today.",
"An unexpected development might interfere with your plans to attend a social event, group activity, or get-together with your partner. This isn't going to sit well with those you've been planning to meet, Taurus. It's going to be frustrating for you, too, but it has to be done. It's best if you just postpone your plans and take care of business. Your friends will forgive you.",
"Doubts about business and financial matters might weigh on your mind now, Taurus, so much so that they invade your dreams. The dreams are only a reflection of your worries - they aren't prophetic. Your situation is probably better than it seems on the surface. Lack of information clouds the issue. Check the facts and judge them for yourself before making yourself crazy.",
"Good news regarding writing, speaking, or publishing could come your way today. You might feel terribly bored with life and suddenly have the urge to get away for a while. This isn't a bad idea, Taurus. Make a few phone calls. Invite a friend over and discuss it with him or her. You've been working hard and a little break is probably in order.",
"If you're currently romantically involved, expect your relationship to reach a new understanding and sense of unity, Taurus. If you aren't involved, you could meet someone special today, and it might be like love at first sight. An instant bond could form between you because of mutual intellectual interests. You might have a lot to talk about, as your own projects are going better than you'd hoped.",
"Unfounded worries about money could plague you today, Taurus. Someone close may have given you some incorrect information, perhaps about your financial situation, but more likely regarding trends in the economy that could affect your finances. Don't waste time worrying. Check out the facts before driving yourself crazy. You will probably find that you've been misinformed.",
"Work you do today, whether related to your job or something you do on your own, could lead to a temporary boost in income, which is going to elevate your mood. This could involve a bonus, a project outside work, or your own enterprise. You should be feeling healthy and enthusiastic, Taurus, ready to tackle just about anything. Finances look stable, and relations with others congenial and supportive.",
"Today you could feel like you have one foot in another world. It's a great feeling, Taurus, with a lot of love and wisdom mixed in. This could prove useful in relating to others. It increases your awareness not only of them but also of yourself. It could make a big difference in any creative projects. Don't let the day go by without making this feeling work for you in some way.",
"If you've been thinking of taking a long trip by air, Taurus, this is the day to start planning it - or even leave, if you can work it in. Your excitement and anticipation are high, and your sense of adventure is at a peak. You won't complete the day without doing something unusual or exciting, such as going to a concert, play, or sporting event. You will remember it for a long time.",
"Practical matters involving home and family might need some attention today. This isn't anything alarming, Taurus, just a few tasks that you may have put off, such as house cleaning or yard work. Get other members of your household to help. You have other responsibilities to see to. It isn't fair to have to do it all by yourself.",
"Group activities in your neighborhood could lead to positive changes in your community. You will enjoy exchanging ideas and information with others, Taurus, and could come away from these activities feeling exhilarated. It might be a good idea to walk home, or perhaps go for coffee or a movie afterward. If you let the ideas buzz until bedtime, you might not be able to sleep.",
"Things are flowing your way, Taurus, and you should find a great deal of pleasure in the company of others. There may be an element of fantasy about the day that causes you to lose track of time and space. Don't bother connecting to reality if you don't have to. Go to an art museum or attend a dance performance. See a movie and go out to your favorite restaurant.",
"Money matters may need your attention today, Taurus, and you probably aren't in the right space to think along those lines. Your mind is on different things, probably on your projects. Nonetheless, if you don't at least make the attempt, you will worry about it all day. Give it your best and ask for help if you have to. Once that's taken care of, you will have the rest of the day to enjoy yourself.",
"Today you may stumble into an unexpected new friendship, Taurus. This could come as the result of a social event or an introduction by a close friend. You will discover new rapport the likes of which you haven't experienced in a long time. You could spend hours trading ideas. Make sure you exchange contact information. You will definitely want to stay in touch with this person.",
"Family, home, and hEarth are on your mind today, Taurus. There may be a community event that you attend out of a sense of obligation but stay for the sheer fun of it. Sometimes you get so caught up in work and the daily hassles of life that you forget there's a whole world outside of work. It does your heart good to take in a wider view.",
"You've never looked better, Taurus. As a result, people are drawn to you and you have an unusually large circle of friends. This is fun but time consuming, as everyone seems to want a piece of you. Try to keep your feet on the ground. Don't let your vision become clouded by all the flattery you receive.",
"You're likely to spend time with someone who energizes and rejuvenates you today. With luck, this meeting won't occur too late in the evening, or else you will have a problem going to sleep, Taurus. This energy is going to give your projects a much-needed boost. You're about to go on a crusade. Choose your quest carefully, Taurus.",
"Some disturbing news could come today, Taurus. This isn't likely to concern you directly. It's apt to be something about the world situation that might eventually reflect indirectly on you. It could be gossip about someone you know. Whatever it is, check it out before accepting it as fact. The information could be garbled. The situation is probably more positive than it seems.",
"If you're currently involved, Taurus, expect to feel a rush of revived passion for your partner. If you aren't currently involved, the one great love of your life could finally appear. You may meet this person through work, creative activities, or spiritual studies. Your new friend could be from far away and work in an intellectually oriented profession. Expect to spend the next few days in a fog!",
"Recent stress could leave you wanting to spend the day shopping for items that may be nice but aren't really necessary, Taurus. This is fine, since you may want to spruce up your surroundings. Take care you don't go overboard, and be careful not to take home something that you wouldn't normally go for. You don't want to have to return an unwanted object to the store.",
"Romantic novels and movies could be more appealing than usual today, Taurus. You're in an especially intense mindset. If you're involved, your relationship could be near the point where it has to move ahead or end. Chances are it will move ahead. If you aren't attached, your loving nature will attract more than one potential partner into your aura. Be prepared, and expect the unexpected.",
"Money that has come your way unexpectedly might have you thinking in terms of expanding your personal interests and holdings, Taurus. You might consider trying some new investments, particularly property. There's no need to rush to make a decision, however. You have all the time in the world to consider different options - and have some fun while you do it.",
"Much of your day may be spent running around your neighborhood, Taurus, perhaps in the company of your partner. You may have a lot of errands to run, or perhaps you're just antsy and unwilling to spend the day indoors. Whichever it is, you may come into contact with some unusual people and events. Take a notebook and camera. You might want a record of it all.",
"Are you involved in a search through every store for a particular item, Taurus? You might be looking for a long time. The object you need won't be found at the local mall. Secondhand shops, obscure boutiques, antique stores outside town - all of these are more likely to have what you want than any shop you'd normally frequent. Be brave and take a chance. You might really enjoy it.",
"Your dreams might be especially intense now, and some could even be prophetic. You may have recently dreamed of an old friend you haven't seen for a while. Don't be surprised if you suddenly hear from this person, Taurus. You might also come up with some previously unknown ideas for advancing yourself professionally. Don't let the unorthodox source of these insights stop you from using them.",
"Have you been working hard to attain optimal health, Taurus? If so, you may suddenly notice that your efforts are finally bearing fruit. You should feel especially fit and strong, though maybe a little lightheaded. You will want to increase your exercise, and you have the discipline to do so. Make the most of this drive while you can. Push yourself as hard as you can without stressing out.",
"A message could come today from a business or romantic partner that brings some welcome news, Taurus. Action on an enterprise of some kind, perhaps involving writing or speaking, could put one or both of you in the limelight. Make the most of the opportunity. It could lead to future advancement and exposure, perhaps even more promising than this. You've worked hard and now you're reaping the rewards.",
"Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Taurus. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or machines break down. It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.",
"If you've been investing, look for it to pay off big. Or you could execute a new contract, settle a claim, or even win something. Expect the unexpected where money is concerned. It might have you reeling. In the past few weeks you've been releasing a lot of negative energy and clearing the way for today's good fortune. Plan to have some wonderful dreams tonight as well.",
"Today you could put a lot of energy into mundane chores and tasks, as you won't want them hanging over your head and interfering with your evening plans. As a result, Taurus, you might feel very stressed and your temper could be a bit short. Try to control it and avoid taking your frustrations out on others. Remember, you will have to face these people again.",
"You may be courting your lover today, Taurus. Whether you're in a relationship or starting one, you're in the mood to seduce your partner with a touch of sophistication. It's time to add to your natural charm - a seductive new scent, attractive outfit, or new haircut. Sometimes changing your appearance makes deeper personality changes than you expect.",
"Unfortunately, Taurus, this may be a period of conflict and tension in your family life, especially where siblings are concerned. Don't you think it's time to deal with these problems once and for all? It would be nice to build a new relationship with them. It might be painful, but it's up to you to take the first step. Call a family meeting and put all your cards on the table.",
"Luck is finally on your side, Taurus. And you deserve it, because you really worked hard to get these results in your life. In astrology, as in life, you can't succeed just by sheer luck. Success is often the result of a lot of energy you expend or something you may have changed on the inside. So continue to give off the positive energy that's responsible for your success.",
"Career interests are advanced through clear, logical thinking and the sound application of good business sense. Financial interests look especially promising now, Taurus, so seize any opportunities for advancement that come your way. Working with others is likely to prove profitable, and could bring you closer to them, too. Roll up your sleeves and go to it. The results could surprise you.",
"If you aren't currently romantically involved, Taurus, today you might suddenly see an old friend or neighbor in a new light. This can be thrilling, but it might not be a good idea to do anything about it just yet. You're feeling especially sensual today, and therefore any attraction you feel could pass by tomorrow. If you're presently involved, schedule a romantic evening with your partner.",
"It's hard to keep your balance when a big rock suddenly falls on one side of the scale, Taurus. Resolving the matter isn't as hard as you think, because this rock has been dropped there as a gift. Even though it might be shocking at first, there's an important message in this surprise. The tricky part is figuring out what it is.",
"You may be a bit confused today, Taurus. More than likely, it will be hard for you to get an accurate read on your emotions. One of your automatic responses in situations like this is to turn to a close partner for advice. Unfortunately, this advice may throw you into even more of a tailspin. What you need more than anything is to spend quality time alone.",
"The desire to make a major purchase of some kind, perhaps a luxury item, might have you counting your pennies today, Taurus. Once they're all counted, you might doubt the wisdom of buying it now. This isn't the day to make a decision either way. Wait a few days and you should see things more clearly and have a better grasp of the situation.",
"You will be in an especially affectionate and loving mood today, Taurus. Your romantic nature is heightened and your nurturing qualities are strong. You're extra sensitive and receptive. You might find that you have no problem communicating your truest feelings to others. Connect with those you feel especially close to, and enjoy an intimate evening.",
"Information received from far away could compel you to learn more about the subject, Taurus. You might be inspired to use your new knowledge in a project that includes a partner. Your mind is insightful now. If you face decisions, this is definitely the day to follow your heart. Don't be surprised if you also find your telepathic abilities expanded.",
"You've been working hard to improve your financial situation, Taurus. You might be on the verge of attaining what you want, but temporary obstacles could get in your way. You could be in a bit of a panic, wondering if this means you will never get where you want to be. Don't worry. That isn't the case. You just need to assess the situation and figure out what to do to get over this hurdle.",
"Miscommunication with someone far away could lead to bruised egos, heightened emotions, and angry phone calls. Don't get sucked into a quarrel, Taurus. Try to sort out the problem. Changes in your neighborhood could cause trouble getting around, so be prepared for blocked streets and heavy traffic. Walk, if you can. It will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.",
"Today you might complete a project that was difficult but important to your career. Acknowledgement of your dedication and hard work could find you more emotionally overwhelmed than makes you comfortable. You may have to make a special effort to control your feelings. You've moved mountains to get where you are and it's nice to be recognized. In the evening, celebrate. You deserve it.",
"Someone or something may spur you on today, Taurus. You may feel a nagging impulse to get up and do something. Follow that instinct and stop moaning about staying in bed. The practical truth may be sobering, but as you know, balance is key. Bring equilibrium to the situation by taking a good, honest look at your emotional state. Realize what you need to do to keep it running smoothly.",
"Service to others might take up a large part of your day, Taurus, perhaps on an artistic level or maybe in the form of sharing psychic or healing energy. Don't think your efforts are unappreciated. Those you're helping may be reticent about saying anything, but your efforts aren't lost on them. Think of it like a bank. Your friends will be there for you when you need them.",
"If you're involved in the study of a particular subject, Taurus, today you might want to bury yourself in your books and learn as much as you can. This is good, because your concentration is especially good. Go to the library or a private room where you won't be distracted and hit the books. Find some new works on the subject if you can. You might discover some surprising information.",
"You may feel insecure about your appearance today, Taurus. This can be a vicious cycle to get into. The result is almost always negative. Rather than pick yourself apart, consider finding ways to accept your looks. Whether it's your weight or age or anything else, if you can't accept yourself, you will always find something wrong no matter how many changes you make.",
"You're known to be kindhearted. However, being taken advantage of can happen as a result. It's important for you to trust your instincts to prevent this from happening. If what you hear doesn't match your feelings, trust your feelings. If you think you're being used, try to move past it. It would be a real shame if resentment permanently squelched your giving nature.",
"Taurus, personal dignity may be important to you today. This may come about when things go wrong or if you're accused of something you didn't do. You always have control over your dignity. Your daily actions affirm this. The key is to hold on tightly to who you are and what you believe in. Defend your dignity if it's challenged. It's one thing that no one can take from you no matter what.",
"If you're feeling tired, Taurus, you may need to lie back, close your eyes, and listen to some soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so it can do your body and mind good to just relax and listen to your favorite music. Why not do this today? Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you have to feel you've accomplished something.",
"Don't fear any changes that lie ahead, Taurus. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant. It wouldn't be long before you became dissatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust your versatility.",
"If there's something you want to take on, Taurus, today's the day. The celestial aspects will see an increase in physical and mental strength that can work wonders for you. Put any insecurity or lack of confidence in the trash, and take the steps you need to tackle your project or goal. You have the ability to make sound judgments, so put your trust in this talent. Take steps to get what you want.",
"Today rethink all the social values you take at face value. Like the rest of us, you learned them at an early age and accepted them unthinkingly. Established concepts of propriety are especially deserving of consideration. After hearing for years about all those things that \"just aren't done,\" isn't it refreshing to think that maybe they should be done after all?",
"Social events and group activities could bring new interests your way that provide a rich field of knowledge for you to delve into, Taurus. Someone could recommend books on the subject. This could be very exciting, especially since a lot of new people who share this interest could come into your life. Be sure to keep track of names and phone numbers. You won't want to lose touch.",
"If there is an imbalance in your relationship with someone close, it's important to take a stand now, Taurus. Make sure you speak your mind with conviction. The stakes are higher when people's egos are involved, as they will be today. You're the air that fuels the fire, so be careful of which way you direct your energy.",
"Things regarding love and romance may be a bit dicey for you, Taurus. You may find that you have to make a few adjustments in order to remain on the same page as your loved ones. Neither one of you may feel like taking the lead at this time, causing some hesitation in the relationship. While each of you is trying to second-guess the other, confusion is likely to reign.",
"The chance to take a trip by air with friends or members of a group could come your way today, Taurus. This might involve an exhibition of some kind, as well as a chance to advance your knowledge in some way. Both the dissemination and the gathering of information are definitely involved. If you can, make the arrangements today. Whatever the journey, it could make a big difference in your life.",
"Increased intuition, imagination, and spiritual insight could inspire you to either undertake a course of study or move ahead with related creative projects, Taurus. You might be very pleasantly surprised at what you learn or produce, and so be motivated to continue with whatever you're doing. This could be an inspiring and productive time for you. Make the most of it!",
"You're a sociable person with a gift for small talk and interesting discussions. Today you will find some amazing information that will keep your conversations fascinating for months. It could involve a new discovery, possibly in a foreign land. A friend or relative you haven't seen for a while could reappear. This is a day full of surprises, Taurus, so be prepared for just about anything!",
"Your laziness isn't making it easy to get out of bed, Taurus. In fact, all you may want to do today is absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, this may not be possible. Whether it is or not, you can make the best of this feeling as long as you keep yourself in the right frame of mind. Find the element of fun in everything you do, including your work.",
"If you need to do errands, Taurus, don't drag others along with you. Complete your mission solo. You will find that you're more efficient if you don't have to carry the extra burden around. Not only will you get your chores done more quickly but you will also have time to think and process certain things without someone else's energy influencing your thinking.",
"A sudden but necessary expense could make a big hole in your budget today, Taurus. Perhaps some repairs need to be made around the house or to the car. Maybe someone needs an unexpected trip to the dentist. This could throw you off balance, but you can manage it by cutting some corners. So what if you have to eat pasta for a week or two? It could be worse! Just move ahead with whatever needs to be done.",
"Low biorhythms may have you feeling less than your usual self, Taurus. Your mind may not be quite as quick as it usually is, and you may go through the day in a bit of a fog, possibly reflecting on the past. This isn't quite as aimless as it sounds. You might want to jot down your memories and reflections. They could shed light on something that's going on with you now.",
"Welcome back to the land of the living, Taurus. You've been so preoccupied with your existential questions lately that you've missed the point about playing the hand that life has dealt you. Now you're more in tune and present in your daily life and more able to recognize and appreciate the joy that you can find moment to moment. It's an important discovery. Well done!",
"An unexpected release of tension could come today, Taurus. Something that has been restricting you and limiting your growth is going to disappear, and you will want to run through the streets shouting. From here on out, certain desires that have eluded you could start to manifest in your life. One of them could be a new romance. What else need be said?",
"The desire to write your thoughts on a subject you've been either thinking about or possibly even researching could arise today, Taurus. If you've been thinking about trying your hand at a magazine article on this or any subject, this is the time to get started. Your mind is sharp and your self-expression free flowing. Go to it!",
"Your attractiveness and sociability are at a peak today, Taurus. Don't hesitate to put both to good use. You will shine brightly at any social occasion, whether you're the host or guest. You radiate warmth and enthusiasm. You draw people to you like a magnet. You may have some important news to share, so don't be surprised if you can't move for all the people gathered around you.",
"Creative work could require more focus and concentration than usual today, Taurus. You might need to do some in-depth research, intricate detail work, or another type of intense process that could strain your eyes and overstimulate your mind. Take breaks. Lie back and close your eyes now and then. Certainly don't forget to eat! By the end of the day, you should be pleased with what you've done.",
"Some great news could come today, Taurus, perhaps from a love partner. It might concern your relationship or it might involve some sort of good fortune coming to either you or your beloved. This bit of luck could free both of you in some way to further advance the relationship somehow. Don't panic and don't overanalyze it. Follow your heart!",
"Money matters might require your attention today, Taurus. Concerns involving the home are on your mind. You may need to work on the household accounts or balance the records of a home business. You may put in more time than necessary. Don't assume the worst! All should be basically well, so you probably could just balance the accounts and move on. You have other things to do, too!",
"A trip to a museum or gallery could bring you some interesting insights, Taurus. Maybe you will ignore the realistic paintings and photographs that used to interest you and admire the abstract works instead. They definitely capture your interest, and by the end of the day you may consider taking an art class to learn more about them.",
"Pay attention today, Taurus. There may be some unethical behavior occurring at work, and it could trigger some long-buried anger. You may have difficulty keeping your emotions in check, but you need to. Honest communication is the only way you can get through this day. Once you've calmed down, you might want to approach the person who's behaving irresponsibly.",
"Unexpected contact with a lover, relative, young person, or close friend could leave you feeling exhilarated and optimistic about the future. More frequent communication with this person will probably result, and it could mean a positive outcome in your life. You might write a lot of letters or make a lot of calls, perhaps tying up loose ends from the past. Face the future, Taurus. Change is coming.",
"Inner transformation is likely to make a big difference in your communications right now, Taurus. Your relationships could improve because you're more open and honest without being too blunt. You seem to have a greater understanding of the needs and desires of those closest to you. Unfortunately, this process could also involve leaving some old friends behind. Don't fight it.",
"Today may have some crazy emotional ups and downs, Taurus. There seems to be an intense cloud seeping into every part of your day. Don't try to fool people. They will see right through you. Bursts of positive energy will pop out of nowhere to remind you of your more important purpose. Try not to get so bogged down in the heaviness of the day that you fail to spot opportunities that arise.",
"You may run into a great deal of opposition from just about every quarter, Taurus. The most frustrating part about this is that even the people you turn to for help will transform the situation into an even bigger mess. Instead of finding relief, you may find more complications and misunderstandings. Perhaps you need to take the situation into your own hands and deal with it yourself.",
"Recent successes have you feeling especially pressured to continue on your path, Taurus. You may have to make some choices regarding your activities outside of career and family. You may have a lot of interests that all mean a lot to you, which makes it difficult to make choices. Don't try to consider it today. Your mind is a bit befuddled. Wait a few days and then consider your options.",
"Your mind is likely to be on your finances today, Taurus, and you may be searching for previously unknown ways to advance yourself. Colleagues or friends could help steer you in the right direction. When it comes to jotting down possibilities, trust your intuition, as it's operating at a very high level. List your possibilities and then let it stew for a few days before going over them again.",
"Dig out the paints and get your creative energy flowing, Taurus. Keep in mind that you might not have the discipline or commitment to finish any project you start today, but you most certainly won't lack creative energy. Merge your mental and emotional processes and have them work together on a blank canvas. Bring beauty to the world by letting yourself shine for others to see.",
"Feel free to upset the equilibrium in order to have your needs met, especially in the bedroom, Taurus. In an effort to maintain the peace and keep everything on an even keel, you've neglected your desires for the sake of pleasing someone else. Making compromises for others can be noble, but it may never get you exactly what you want. This is a time to be more aggressive in your pursuit of love.",
"Don't let the positive energy of the day pass you by, Taurus. You're able to grab hold and make greater use of it than most, so don't hesitate to get going early and keep on going until late. Stop contemplating the issues and take action. Take the best aspects of each side of the issue instead of feeling like you're restricted to one side or the other.",
"You might be extremely busy now. Invitations to large parties, small gatherings with close friends, and intimate evenings with romantic partners might come up today. Be discriminating in those you accept, Taurus. Concentrate on seeing people who share your interests. This may bring new friends your way, as well as opportunities to expand your horizons. Romance looks great now.",
"Finding balance in your world will be no sweat once you get into the groove, Taurus. Waking up is likely to be the most difficult part of the day, but once you conquer that incredible feat, you should be fine. Try taking a cold shower instead of a warm one this morning. This will serve to open up your mind and get your blood pumping when you need it most.",
"Look for answers to your question today, Taurus. The good news is that the answers are now out there and easily accessible. Seek the truth and you will find it. Make sure you probe more deeply than you might think to do. Instead of just asking for the answer, seek to find the full mechanics behind the problem. In this way, you're much more likely to find ultimate success.",
"If you've been thinking of buying a new home, Taurus, this is an excellent time to do it. Surprising developments might clear the way for you. Success through investments of any kind, particularly real estate, looms on the horizon. A young visitor may come to your home today, as well as an important letter or call. In the evening, visit an older friend or relative.",
"You may be working on a large project that draws on your creative energy, Taurus. In terms of long-term goals and dreams, this sort of project is right up your alley. Today you might hit a snag or some sort of emotional block that could make it hard for you to continue. Slow down and take a break. Don't get discouraged.",
"Go deeper beneath the surface today, Taurus. You may get along just fine with the way you now handle things. Keep in mind, however, that you aren't likely to progress down your path until you turn up the intensity. If you don't, you may find that someone turns it up for you. Suddenly, volatile emotions could catch you by surprise and you will be floundering for support. Stay ahead of the game.",
"Taurus, you're likely to be giving a lot of thought to your future. You're probably wondering how best to increase your financial standing. You may be thinking in terms of making some investments in land or property. If you've been considering buying a home, this is a good time to do it. Any paperwork involved now should be finalized swiftly and smoothly.",
"In order to reach your destination, you may have to take an unusual route today, Taurus. Zigzag your way to the finish line. Don't automatically assume that this is a bad thing. You may find that this is the preferred path. You're likely to experience many side adventures and make some wonderful discoveries. Try to remember how you got there so you can find these spots again.",
"People may have missed your company lately, Taurus. Make an appearance where you know it will be noticed and appreciated. Look for the good points in others instead of being so judgmental about the bad points. People aren't going to miss you at all if you talk about them behind their backs and only mention the unappealing parts of their personalities.",
"Make sure you keep up your end of the bargain today, Taurus. People are counting on you whether you realize it or not. You may get the idea that you can sneak out of responsibility if you lay low and not say a word. The fact of the matter is that people are watching you and they will know when you haven't upheld your promises to the group.",
"Taking care of chores around the house might bring some home matters to your attention that need to be taken care of, Taurus. Perhaps there are a few minor repairs to make, or maybe you need a new piece of equipment or furniture. You should be optimistic about the future and confident enough to get back into your daily routine without feeling any letdown.",
"You should feel especially strong, motivated, and focused, Taurus. Your ability to establish yourself in the world is enhanced by increased self-sufficiency. Your goals seem more attainable, and you find this encouraging. Relations with others should be warm, congenial, and cooperative, so if you've been thinking of starting some sort of enterprise with others, this is the day to start planning.",
"There could be a meeting in your community regarding some extensive changes in the not too distant future, Taurus. The meeting could bring facts to your attention that you should be aware of. The changes are likely to be positive in the end, but now they could be disruptive for all. Listen carefully to what everyone says, think about it, and then determine your position.",
"Today is going to present not only a continuation but also an intensification of the strong energies that have been pushing you toward self-discovery. If you've put up some resistance, you're going to be uncomfortable. Try to participate in the task. Question yourself. Why do you say and do certain things? If you're honest, the rewards will outweigh the growing pains.",
"Your level of physical and mental energy is high today, Taurus. You may have been overindulging in food and drink lately, and so you could spend much of the day working out at the gym. Take a good book to read in the sauna, because you will also want the mental stimulation. At the end of the day you will feel good about yourself and ready to overindulge some more!",
"You're peerless when it comes to your ability to sway others to your point of view, Taurus. Today you may be put on the spot and asked to defend a position in front of many people. You will do just fine, surprising everyone but you. You handle a microphone with ease and work an audience until they're putty in your hands. You could sell anything!",
"Your inspiration and creativity are high today, Taurus. If you've been thinking about taking up painting or poetry, this would be an ideal day to get started. Make sure your perfectionism doesn't get in the way of your creative urges. You can be a critical editor. For now, don't worry about the end product. If you enjoy the creative process, the end result will reflect your joy.",
"You may be worried about your financial situation today, Taurus. You might feel a tug at your purse strings. If you've experienced a delay in receiving some funds you were expecting, this may add to your concern. You might want to tackle this directly by examining your situation. Check up on expected funds and make any necessary arrangements to alleviate this stress.",
"Even though you're slaving away at work, your mind is very much on romance. Passion is running high, especially yours, Taurus! If you already have a romantic partner, why not plan an intimate evening together? If you don't yet have someone special in your life, it's likely you will meet someone today or soon thereafter. Make sure you look your best at all times!",
"Staying indoors might not be the best thing today, Taurus. You might feel vague muscular aches and pains for which you can't find any reason. They could be the result of inactivity rather than any dysfunction. Get outside and go for a walk or jog in the park. This will get the endorphins going and wipe away the memory of how you felt earlier. Have fun!",
"Taurus, plans to attend a lecture may have to be postponed because someone who's going with you feels under the weather. Overindulgence in food or drink may be the reason. This could be something you've wanted to attend for a long time, so make sure you know when and where the event will take place again. Either that or ply your friend with antacids and go anyway!",
"People could be exploding with rage all around, and you may wonder what the big deal is. If anyone is likely to have a level head through today's chaos, it's you, and this gives you a tremendous advantage in any situation. The beauty of it is that you should be able to use these situations to your advantage. You understand the different sides and you know how to make them work for you.",
"Don't try to fit into a mold you simply don't belong in, Taurus. You may have gone through a major transformation lately in which you went from being a square peg to a round peg. Other people might still be trying to push you into the square hole. Don't let them. Let people know that it upsets you not to be treated the way you want to be treated.",
"Stay at home tonight and cook a delicious meal for you and someone you love, Taurus. You will gravitate toward beauty, both tangible and intangible. In fact, it might be a good day to go shopping, as long as you can control the urge to overspend. Don't let your self- worth be equated with how many shiny toys you have. Splurge a bit, but try not to go overboard.",
"Do something that inspires the passion within you, Taurus. Don't be discouraged by setbacks - be motivated. Use discipline and patience to set your dreams in motion. Be realistic in your approach. The time has come to face the music. Whatever you do, don't shrink into the background and expect others to take care of things for you. The only one who acts in your best interests is you.",
"A sudden fascination with metaphysical or spiritual concepts could have you wanting to read as much as you can on the subject, Taurus. Your enthusiasm could lead you in a dozen different directions, which could eventually lead to mental overload. It might be a better idea to take one subject at a time than try to learn about them all at once. Stay focused!",
"This will be a day rich in reflection, Taurus. You're able to observe what is going around you while still retaining your distance. Other people's ambitions will seem amusing to you as they play their parts more like caricatures than real people. Stepping back like this does you good. You should do it more often.",
"This is a moment to start being creative in your life and stop being afraid of not having any talent. Who's to say what talent is? And in the romance department, the love of your life might be right in front of you. Try lifting your eyes from the romance novels and look around, Taurus. The perfect mate could be any number of people in your daily life. You just have to let yourself see.",
"Today everyone will notice how attractive, articulate, and charming you are, Taurus. This is an excellent time to invite friends over or go out with them. Romance should go particularly well. In the course of your conversations, you might become aware of some fascinating and useful information that sparks you on to new interests and possibly new opportunities. Hold onto them and take the next steps.",
"You're looking great today, Taurus! A current or potential love partner who lives nearby is likely to be all too aware of this. Your heightened sensuality should be very apparent! A long walk with your friend could involve conversation that brings you closer together. You might spend most of the evening together. Expect a lot of kissing and handholding - maybe more!",
"Some rather shocking news could come to you from a friend who lives far away, Taurus. This probably won't affect you directly, as it most likely concerns the world economy, politics, or big business, but you still might worry about its long-term effects on society. You could discuss it with friends. You need to remain objective and see how the news develops. It might be less serious than it seems.",
"Take care that you don't spend beyond your means, Taurus. There's no doubt about it - you like to shop! Today you're at risk of buying too much on impulse, leaving you with a closet full of clothes that may not suit you. Instead, fulfill your shopping tendencies in other ways. Browse a library or museum where you can enjoy all the artistic riches without having to spend any money.",
"This is a good day to make your list and check it twice, Taurus. There is room for improvement in the way you organize your life. Your system at home, such as it is, isn't particularly efficient. Your bill paying is haphazard, and you may be surprised by how much you pay in late fees. Your in-box threatens to bury you. You need a system, Taurus! If this isn't your strong suit, hire some help.",
"A heightened sense of idealized romance could hit you today, Taurus. If you aren't currently involved, beware! That wonderful new person you've just met may have a well-hidden side. If you're currently involved, expect a simultaneous high from romantic exhilaration and insecurity that maybe your beloved doesn't love you anymore. Either way, try to forget it. You will be more objective tomorrow.",
"Offer your services to others, Taurus. Your generosity in spreading your knowledge will be rewarded. Things might be rather confusing at first, but once you start talking, you will be surprised by how much you really know and how far your incredible wit, manners, and sociable attitude can take you. Try your best to reach out to others without seeming needy or demanding.",
"Are you an artist, writer, or musician, Taurus? If so, your work may take on a more symbolic or impressionistic tone. Today you're probably more interested in conveying feelings and impressions than details. It might surprise you that you're thinking along those lines. This urge may vanish tomorrow, so if you like today's work, make the most of it. Try to remember how and why you're doing it!",
"Creative energy may be high today, Taurus, but you may be unable to use it the way you'd like. Perhaps you don't have a project to work on or you have writer's block. Ideas may come, but you don't know what to do with them. The best course may be to write them down. The very process of writing could open doors for you. At least you will have your thoughts for another day.",
"Are you having problems with your phone, Taurus? Is traffic out of control? Perhaps it might be best to stay home today and put conversations with your friends on hold for a while. You might miss a call from someone far away, but the person will try to reach you later. Relax, make yourself some tea, and enjoy the silence. A little quiet time now and then is good for you.",
"Keep your eyes and ears open today, Taurus. You may receive some important information on specific ways to increase your income. This is just one of the many wonderful things bound to happen to you. You're looking great and people are responding to your warm, pleasant manner. Bask in the glow of all the goodwill surrounding you. It won't last forever!",
"Airline travel is indicated in your immediate future, Taurus. It's likely you've been feeling serious wanderlust lately, as well as frustration with the same old routine. Be open to any interesting invitations that come your way today. If a friend invites you for a night out on the town, go despite any hesitation. You're bound to have a wonderful time, and you need the diversion.",
"Share your skills today, Taurus. You will find that as you engage in the role of teacher, you learn more than if you just hold onto your knowledge without sharing it. You will be challenged in ways you didn't even think possible. Perhaps you will be forced to do a little research when questions arise that you don't know how to answer.",
"Today you will likely be in the mood to nest with loved ones, Taurus. Encourage children and partner to stay home with you. Make some popcorn and pull out the board games. You will be surprised at how much fun a quiet day at home can be. Tonight, order pizza and watch a movie. Get out the blanket and cuddle.",
"Today you might work on your spiritual practice or studies, Taurus. You could read a book on the subject, attend a lecture, or practice some kind of discipline such as yoga or meditation. The only caveat is don't try to do too much at once. You could tire yourself out. Concentrate on one thing at a time. The information will still be there tomorrow!",
"Sign up for a class or workshop today. Your career could greatly benefit from more training. A short computer course might be all you need to move your career a giant leap forward. Don't neglect your artistic abilities, Taurus. Ideally, you will find a way to integrate your creative talents into your daily business life. There's always room for creativity.",
"Your energy may flag a bit today, Taurus. There's nothing to worry about, though you could take better care of your health. What happened to that exercise regimen you vowed to start? It's never too late to improve your eating habits and begin working out. Even if you only walk three times a week, you will notice a dramatic difference in your appearance and outlook.",
"Today you might want to think about getting things straight with the people close to you. It's possible you haven't dealt with any problems you had in your relationships last month, Taurus. It's time to look at things again. You may have hidden certain things from yourself. You need to be much more honest about what you want in your personal life.",
"You were born with a certain grace and beauty, Taurus. Today you will be able to cultivate your love for beautiful things. You may feel like trying on designer clothes or expressing your innate aesthetic sense by painting. Today your five senses will guide you with the help of your imagination and your artist's temperament.",
"A number of loving communications may come your way from people who live in distant states or exotic lands. You're feeling especially affectionate now, Taurus, particularly regarding those closest to you. It might not be a bad idea to get on the phone and talk to people you may not have seen in a long time. They will be glad to hear from you!",
"A friend may be throwing a party and you might be expected to attend. You've probably had a stressful day and really don't feel up to it. Your friend may try to induce you to come by making you feel guilty. Don't fall into that trap. Go only if you feel that the value of the occasion overrides your need to rest. Your friend will forgive you if you say no.",
"Until now, you may have been too stubborn about doing what you want without trying to address the question of your financial means, Taurus. Even if it seems too materialistic, It's urgent that you take care of this question. Push ahead and try to raise your standard of living, because you have something to learn in this domain.",
"The astral configuration indicates that you may be interested in pursuing some kind of training, Taurus. Assess where you are in your professional life. Are you up to persuading people with your expertise? Don't think that you have to know more in order to be a good teacher. In fact, it's often by teaching that the teacher learns the subject.",
"Today is your day, Taurus! Do your best to make your mark on the people around you, especially those closest to your heart. You will outdo yourself, grabbing attention without even meaning to. You will be considered very attractive. Don't be surprised if your calendar fills up. This is your reward for all your work over the past few weeks.",
"Everyone needs to be loved, Taurus, but it shouldn't be your only objective in life. It isn't the end of the world if your charms fall flat every once in a while. Today you may be tempted to be a little less charming and seductive with the people around you. Some may even say you aren't acting like your usual self. Ignore them. A little self-indulgence now and then never hurt anyone.",
"Taurus, you don't have to be at everyone's beck and call all the time. This is exhausting, and you lose contact with yourself. You should try to take some time out today. Take a good look at your life to see where you're going. Go for a walk or take a long bubble bath. Things will be much clearer after a relaxing day of reflection.",
"Frustration could be the word for today. If you've made plans to meet a close friend or lover, Taurus, don't count on it happening. Unexpected events might force a postponement. Problems with schedules could have you playing phone tag. This also isn't a good day to work on creative or artistic projects. The results you want could prove elusive. Spend the day reading!",
"The desire to meet with a romantic partner and look and feel your best could give rise to a lot of short journeys in your area. Perhaps you will want to work out, buy some new clothes, or get a haircut. This might be a good idea. Passions promise to run high today. Stimulating conversations could bring fascinating information to light.",
"A surge of romantic passion could move you to rendezvous with a lover no matter what obstacles bar your way. Take care to notice what your partner wants! Enterprises that you may have been pursuing with business colleagues could take a giant step forward, as both you and your partners are feeling especially strong and motivated. Move forward with caution, Taurus, but move forward.",
"You could be operating based on an assumption that's only a partial representation of the truth. In your effort to think about only the good side of the situation, Taurus, you may not see the entire truth. There's a downside to everything. Feelings of anger, frustration, and even loneliness may go along with it.",
"This is a great time to move forward on a writing project, Taurus. Any large, long-term project involving communication, film, or long-distance travel is begging you to take action. Don't delay. You have a strong force urging you to move forward. Look ahead with a positive attitude instead of thinking of all the reasons why these projects won't pan out the way you want them to.",
"You feel confident. People can't help but notice as you radiate a loving, peaceful calm, Taurus. Eyes will turn your way, and complete strangers may come up to you and tell you how attractive you are. Be confident yet humble and you will inspire people just by your peaceful, glowing presence. Take advantage of this wonderful day by enjoying yourself for the beautiful person you are.",
"Today a number of chores around the home could have you feeling overwhelmed, Taurus. Family members might abandon you, leaving you disgruntled. Do the most pressing and leave the rest for when they're home! There might be a difference of opinion between you and your mate. Try to see both sides of the issue and circumvent any serious disagreements.",
"Today you may be impressed by the powers of concentration and self-discipline of one of your friends. There's a lesson to be learned from your admiring stance, though. The fact that you recognize these qualities in others means that you're making progress. Don't be shy, Taurus. Strut your stuff!",
"The day is likely to be confrontational. The latest developments in your career have offered you so little encouragement that you're tempted to cut back on your efforts, but your financial situation is forcing you to try even harder. The flashes of insight you gain today are only likely to increase your discomfort, but in the end they will provide some valuable information.",
"Disturbing dreams or unsettling moods could arise today, causing you to wonder if something is wrong or something bad is going to happen. Let it go, Taurus. If anything goes wrong, it isn't likely to be anything major. A recent event may have triggered old impressions that are causing these feelings. You could also be picking up on others' moods, as your intuition is high.",
"Taurus, the romantic side of your life may be rocked by a storm of emotion. You may go from intense rage to ecstasy in an instant. The day may instruct you to get hold of your emotions. If you hope to build a stable relationship, it's necessary to maintain psychological coherence and physical health.",
"A planetary configuration like today's often makes people afraid to start anything that challenges the status quo. This is true for you in your professional life. You should dare to take on more responsibility. The aspects speak of fear only, not of being incapable of succeeding. The saying about fear being the only thing to fear is something you should take to heart right now, Taurus.",
"The celestial configuration is speaking of a new period in which you focus on the way you differentiate yourself from others, Taurus. Are you aware of the aspects that make you unique? If not, meditate on the subject or ask close friends for input. The upcoming weeks are going to teach you a lot about this subject!",
"Money matters might be weighing on the mind of a close friend or lover, Taurus, and he or she might seek your advice. A creative project may require a larger expenditure of money, time, or other resources than you originally thought. This could make you wonder if you will be able to continue with it. It might take some tweaking on your part, but you should be able to complete it as planned.",
"Taurus, you should feel physically strong and energetic today and ready to take on just about anything that comes your way. This is good, as you may be presented with some powerful challenges that bring new purpose to your life. Excitement and enthusiasm permeate your entire being right now. Anything that comes your way you're likely to face with determination, undeterred by the enormity of the task.",
"You may be pushed around by two very powerful camps today, Taurus. Since you're the kind, diplomatic, and sensitive type, you make the perfect target for the more abrasive and opinionated. You may want to side with the cold, hard facts presented to you, although there is a great deal of emotional power working to stir up the pot. Things may not be as clear as they seem at first glance.",
"It's like you have to do everything at the same time right now, Taurus. What you really need is an extra pair of hands and some additional hours in the day! It's your nerves that may pay the price for this fast-paced existence. You can't go on like this. Rather than give up on your goals, why not give yourself more time to reach them?",
"There are powerful forces operating now, Taurus. Whether you realize it or not, you have tremendous control over the direction of these energies. Take control of the situation instead of letting someone else do it for you. You will find that other people are more malleable than usual, making them quite willing to move forward in whatever direction you point them.",
"You may find that there is some opposition from other people today, Taurus, especially concerning emotions. You may feel threatened in some way. An aggressive attitude could be making you feel inferior or unworthy of certain attention. Wanting peace, justice, and harmony doesn't make you wimpy or inferior, as some people may suggest. These qualities are your strengths, not your weaknesses.",
"Yes, Taurus, you haven't finished all the cleaning up that remains in many areas. You're going to have to get your papers in order, pay off old debts, face physical or moral obligations, and fix technical problems. That's a lot of work! Fortunately, once it's done, your emotional baggage will be considerably lighter, enabling you to go farther and faster.",
"Your mind may be going in many different directions, with fantastic ideas about how things should be done, Taurus. The difficulty is communicating these ideas in a way that makes sense. Others may see you as a threat to their authority. Perhaps they feel your ideas would undermine their plans, so they reject them. Don't give up. Fight for your right to be heard and respected.",
"Overdue apologies can be made today, Taurus. It isn't easy to admit you're wrong, but the planetary aspects can boost your courage. Rather than stew with regret, meet with the person to make amends. Regardless of any discomfort, you will definitely find that you feel a lot better afterward. Even if the other person isn't receptive, you will be able to say what needs to be said.",
"Emotionally, you should feel good today, Taurus, so don't let this confidence go to waste. Do things with your sweetheart and turn the dial up on romance. Your inner light is shining brightly, so know that you can use this to illuminate the path for others. Offer a sympathetic ear and comforting shoulder for someone to cry on tonight. People will be drawn to you like steel to a magnet.",
"This is a moment to start being creative and stop worrying that you don't have talent, Taurus. Who's to say what \"talent\" is? In the romance department, the love of your life might be right under your nose. Try lifting your eyes from the romance novels and look around. The perfect mate could be any number of people in your daily life. You just have to open your eyes.",
"Don't feel badly about things you have no control over, Taurus. Tonight it would be good for you to go out and have a nice time. Put aside your responsibilities and concentrate on fun. It might be difficult to jump-start others to action, but don't let that concern you. If people don't want to budge, don't force them. They will move when they're ready.",
"The past month has allowed you to affirm yourself, Taurus, and cement some aspects of your personality. You're now entering a period of consolidation. It's like you conceived a product, created it, and are now finally ready to put it on the market. The current period indicates that you will receive all of the rewards that your hard work has earned.",
"This is a wonderful day. You feel emotionally strong, Taurus. You have all of your energy available for use. Don't miss this opportunity by feigning a headache and staying at home doing nothing. Instead of analyzing everything and criticizing everyone else's life, look at your own and see what choices you can make right now. Take the best course of action based on the resources you have at your fingertips.",
"Feel free to express your independent attitude today, Taurus. Break out of any restrictions that might be keeping you from doing what you want to do. Also, make sure you aren't compromising your own needs for those of others. Things should naturally flow your way, and you should be in a good mood for most of your waking hours. Smile at the people around you.",
"Focus on the simple pleasures today, Taurus. Don't feel like you have to go to distant lands or engage in expensive recreational activities to find happiness and peace. Realize that everything you need is inside. Delight in nature. Smile at the Sun, Moon, and stars. Realize that there is beauty all around and not just in expensive objects you can buy.",
"Break away from all mental constraints today, Taurus. The only thing holding you back could be your own mind. Don't fear failure. The cards are in your favor. Move forward with the attitude that you're going to succeed, and you will. Your emotions are strong and active. Things are resonating well for you, so speak your mind openly.",
"Today isn't the best day to play practical jokes, Taurus, so put away the disappearing ink. Stick close to home. Find security in doing things you know how to do best. Hang a painting and cook a scrumptious dinner. You can inspire others with your smile, so use it. Don't get down if your thoughts aren't flowing well with the group. This is a sign that you should spend some time alone.",
"Play the lottery today, Taurus. The concept for you is profit with no effort. The windfall will come when you least expect it. The less you try to shape things, the more they will generally flow in your favor. Enjoy the day and don't sweat the details. Things will work themselves out. People may be quite emotionally charged, but don't let their behavior throw you off balance.",
"You may have a hard time figuring out why everyone is so worked up today. Don't waste your time, Taurus. You're better off accepting that things simply are the way they are and allowing other people to have their drama. Your job is to maintain balance. This may be easier said than done. You're working with some pretty intense issues, but nothing you can't handle.",
"Be more sensitive to other people's space today, Taurus. Respect their feelings and give them room to breathe. This is a great day to pursue creative projects. Do things involving art or music. Sing, play an instrument, or give your music collection a boost. There are opportunities open now that involve other people who share the same interests as you.",
"Your artistic nature is especially heightened today, Taurus. Your heart and brain are working together to create something great. Use your creative abilities to make a bold statement. Have a good time. There may be a tendency toward laziness. If sitting on the couch is all you want to do, that's fine. Realize that there's a great deal of potential energy available to you if you choose to harness it.",
"Things will flow smoothly for you, Taurus. There's barely a reason for you to lift a finger. You have the good fortune of enjoying this day with very little effort on your part. Keep in mind that if you decide to get something done, you will be extremely successful and able to accomplish quite a bit. You're in sync with today's energy.",
"Despite all your rage, you're still just a rat in a cage. Get out of your box, Taurus. Influences from other people may cause some serious transformation in your mindset. Let your belief systems loose to morph into other frames of mind. Consider new ways of living. Do things to get out of the social confines of how you should live your life.",
"Other people may be stroking your fur in the wrong direction, Taurus. There's a great deal of fiery energy in the air today that's promoting a \"me first\" attitude. It may come in direct conflict with your peaceful, diplomatic nature. Also, people may be a bit more sensitive than usual. It will be harder to stomach the slights or insults that result. You have your work cut out for you.",
"Your expansive, outwardly directed plans are moving at full force, but once in a while self-doubt slows things down, Taurus. Today is one of those days in which insecurity may hamper your progress. The secret to success is to consider all the options and trust your instincts. Use your keen powers of observation to collect data and arrange facts in an orderly fashion.",
"Today you could learn a lot from other people who are similar to you, Taurus. They have the ability to get involved easily and go straight to the heart of any problem. The world is in constant flux. You have to question yourself if you want to attain your objectives. Try to be open-minded, adapt to the situation, and act before it's too late.",
"You're a real master of seduction, Taurus. For quite some time, you've been able to draw a number of people to you. It seems that no one can resist your charms. But today you will start thinking about this process of seduction. Even if you appreciate luxury, you should be careful and stay vigilant.",
"Your philanthropic side is fading. You're used to thinking about others before thinking about yourself, but today, things are about to change. Indeed, you fascinate those around you. You've found a new freedom. It seems that you're liberated from your old self and totally fulfilled.",
"You have quite the juggling act on your hands today, Taurus. Things may fly at you from all directions, all demanding your attention. Give equal weight to your needs. You will be on an important road with a great deal of responsibility. Don't shy away from a starring role. You have the diplomacy and peaceful nature required to be a successful leader.",
"Open up and reveal more of your sensitive side, Taurus. The more willing you are to share with others, the more they will feel comfortable sharing things with you. Your head and heart are in agreement, so use this to your advantage. Ground your mind and use it to take a rational approach to your feelings. The truth of the situation will become clear.",
"It may seem like close loved ones are trying to pick a fight with you today, Taurus. There may tend to be a \"me first\" attitude stirring up a pot of trouble. Don't automatically assume that the other person is wrong. There's a valuable lesson to be learned in every conflict. Take each disagreement as an opportunity to learn something about yourself.",
"Whatever you visualize today will likely materialize in the near future, Taurus. People are clamoring to make themselves heard, so jump in with your opinion. Keeping things balanced in your world means getting your needs met as well. Don't sacrifice your well-being just to maintain the peace. Make changes that benefit all parties involved.",
"This is an excellent day for you, Taurus. The farther you extend your emotions, the more prosperous you will be. Don't be afraid of new things. More than likely, the new things entering your life now will make the most sense later. Trust that your heart knows the direction to take. Be generous with your time and energy.",
"You're in tune with the atmosphere around you today because of your tolerance, humanity, and the respect you have for everyone, no matter what their position in society or intellectual capacity. Generosity is coming alive inside you, Taurus. The one thing you want to do is understand the people close to you. Support them and show them that they can count on you.",
"You may have been saving up for something you really wanted, Taurus, when an unexpected expense compels you to spend some of your savings. This could cause some gloom. Make sure you've exhausted all of your other options before digging into your nest egg. Appearances could be deceiving. There could be other resources at your disposal that you didn't immediately think of.",
"Possible ideas for artistic projects could come to you, Taurus, though some of them may be vague and not yet ready to manifest. You may seek to express your spiritual side through artistic activity, but might not quite have a handle on how to do it. Don't force it. Find something else to do and let it sit for a while. You might be surprised by the final results.",
"A new romance or friendship could develop with someone who's very creative and shares your spiritual values. This is a very positive development, Taurus. Just avoid idealizing your new friend. This person is human like everyone else, and needs to be loved as is. Don't create an unrealistic impression of the person. If you acknowledge and accept this, a rewarding new relationship could result.",
"A friend may seem in a dark and gloomy mood and unwilling to talk about it. Don't force the issue. This probably has more to do with your friend's circumstances than with you, Taurus. It's best if you continue to pursue your cherished goals. Not only could you advance your interests but you might also inspire your friend and bring him or her out of the dumps. Go for the gold.",
"Hard work, enthusiasm, and dedication are now paying off financially, Taurus. New opportunities are opening up to profitably make use of your artistic side. The downside is that you might be working so hard that you're too drained to be creative even though the inspiration is there. Take a moment to rework your schedule to accomplish the most in the least amount of time. You can do it.",
"Some kind of settlement, grant, or bonus that you've anticipated for a long time may finally show up, Taurus. This should make your day! You may want to celebrate.

Keep a notebook and pen by your bed so you can write them down.",
"Although you're normally a sociable person who feels most comfortable in the company of others, Taurus, today you may prefer to be alone.

You probably need rest, but you might also benefit from taking a walk to work off some tension, get the endorphins going, and help you feel like yourself again.",
"Get your chores done early, Taurus, so you have time to play tonight. Plan a romantic getaway with a loved one. Let your imagination carry you to a whole new realm of pleasure.

You will probably grow closer to those who mean the most to you now, including the very special person in your life.",
"Today is a day of contrasts, Taurus. Eat chocolate in the morning and go jogging in the afternoon. Sleep in late and go to bed early. It's also a day of grounding. Spend time at home and make more calls than you normally would. Clean your desk and organize a bookshelf. Why not clean out the refrigerator? Take care of your pets.",
"You may need some time alone today to bring yourself back to center, Taurus. Independence is the key idea to keep in your back pocket. Make sure you're not becoming a victim to a commitment you made long ago. As the landscape changes, you must also change. Stubborn actions will be detrimental on a day like this. Be honest and grateful for the things you have.",
"It will be a challenge to keep your emotions on an even keel today, Taurus. Conflict may be brewing and you might fear it could get out of hand. Everything will work out. Don't add to the pressure. The best solution is to escape into reverie and come back to Earth when the storm has passed. Don't try to untangle the knots if they won't give.",
"There's no excuse for laziness today, Taurus. Get out of bed before noon. The more active you are, the happier you will be. Come out of your cave and express your thoughts to others. Get out in the open air and listen to what the wind has to say. Be active and flexible. There's nothing heavy about people's emotions today, so keep things light and active.",
"Maintaining equilibrium may not be the easiest task today, but if anyone can do it, you can, Taurus. Strong opinions from others could crop up to challenge you. You have a great deal of ammunition in your arsenal. You can learn quite a bit by accepting this challenge and engaging in a heated debate. Have faith in yourself.",
"If there's an issue with your partner that needs airing, this is a good time to do it, Taurus. Don't hold back just to maintain the equilibrium in the relationship.

Be totally honest with yourself, your feelings, and other people.",
"Let yourself go into creative mode today, Taurus. Drift into a whole other world. Escape your present reality and explore your fantasies through artistic endeavors.

You may be able to soar much higher than you think.",
"Today is a terrific day, Taurus, and you can get a lot accomplished using your quick mind and sharp wit. Information is flying quickly. Grab what resonates with you and discard the rest.

You have the ability to make favorable impressions on just about everyone, so set the day off on the right foot. Get out of bed earlier than usual and get your blood pumping with a brisk walk around the neighborhood.",
"Try not to smother others, Taurus. You may want to seek comfort in their company, but this will only produce grouchiness in all parties involved. Curb your tendency to find fault with the ones you love. Your best bet is to focus on tasks you have on the back burner. Tackle projects that need special attention and discipline.",
"You have an incredibly strong influence on others today, Taurus, just because yours is a fun-loving, peaceful, and harmonious nature.

"You're a social creature, Taurus, and today you can expect to attract a lot of attention. You're feeling good and looking even better - and don't think that people don't notice! Make it a point to get out and mingle with others. You're a talented, capable person in your own right, but you really shine when you're with others. This is especially true today.",
"Jump on board the fast train and see how far it takes you, Taurus. You'll be surprised at how far you can go with minimal effort. Your grace and polite social mannerisms will help you navigate quickly to where you need to be. You have the wind at your back today. Make the most of this energy by aiming for the top and not resting until you get there.",

Make sure you have your internal maelstrom of thoughts settled before you get tangled up in others' affairs.",
"Emotionally speaking, things might get tense for you today as others demonstrate a rather selfish attitude, Taurus. Remember that selfishness isn't always considered negative.

Don't try to pick a fight when other people also demonstrate this behavior.",

You're going to go on a crusade! Choose carefully.",
"As you work to keep things in balance today, Taurus, remember that one of the key things is to have fun.

A smile can get you through just about any door you wish to enter.",
"Taurus, you may feel like you're running in several directions at once. You're so scattered that you don't feel like you're accomplishing anything important. That's just the nature of the day. You have many loose ends to tie up. It's hard to concentrate on the big picture when you're out of groceries. Do whatever maintenance needs doing so you can move on to bigger things.",
"Mind your manners today, Taurus. Make sure your charm is turned up high. Merging with the group is essential as you keep the momentum of the energy going. The more the merrier.

"Keeping things in balance may be more trouble than it's worth, Taurus, so don't force the issue. Sometimes it's necessary for our personal growth to let the pendulum swing all the way to one side. The more you can let go and accept that everything isn't going to always be peaceful and harmonious, the better able you will be to deal with the sudden emotional turmoil that is bound to arise.",
"You may find yourself running in a million different directions, Taurus. This is a good day to do errands. You can juggle many things at once, so continue with confidence.

"Be a little selfish, Taurus. Be honest and straightforward with what you want. There's no need to beat around the bush simply because you want to spare someone's feelings. You will do everyone a favor by laying it out clearly. Refrain from playing mind games just to see how much you can twist people into knots. Such actions will later come back to haunt you.",
"You could feel blocked, Taurus, like you're in a trap. Perhaps your friends are influencing you into believing one thing, while your family has you trained to believe another. You wear different masks in different situations so you may have forgotten the real person underneath. Things are in conflict, and you may be forced to make important decisions. The truth is the only way to escape the trap.",
"Ideas are intriguing today, Taurus. You might feel like a kid in a candy store seeing new treats for the first time. New concepts are pulling you in, and you love every minute of it. Run with it. Your mind is exploring new realms, and you shouldn't try to hold it back. Collect the data now and sort through it later. This is a time for adventure.",

Use your communicative powers to help bridge the gap.",
"Something or someone may urge you to make a major move, Taurus. Be sure you make it in the right direction. Remember that strength lies in numbers. To conquer, people must unite.

"Do you wonder whether other people are attracted to you, Taurus? If you'd like to reassure yourself, you could work on your outward appearance today.

"This could be the luckiest day of the month, Taurus. But astrology also takes your role into account. In other words, luck is something you have to work for. If you seem to have an incredible streak of luck today, it's probably because you did something earlier to make it happen!",
"Trying to talk your way out of tasks and obligations probably isn't the best way to win friends today, Taurus. In fact, this is a time to get yourself in gear and take responsibility for your actions. The time you spend trying to weasel your way out of something is better spent just doing the thing that you need to do. Be understanding and receptive of other people's objectives.",

"Your love partner may be experiencing some minor conflicts with colleagues today, Taurus, and may seem distant and preoccupied. The problem could well pass by tomorrow, but your friend isn't likely to listen to any reassurance. Just make it clear that you're there if needed and then do something else. Your beloved may have to come to terms with this alone.",
"Today you could find that you've left something at home, perhaps a book or letter that you need. There's no way around it, Taurus, you'll have to go back. This could make you late. Stay calm! This is a temporary irritation that will pass. Making yourself crazy over it will only stress you out. At lunch, treat yourself to a glass of wine or a soothing cup of tea.",
"A friend could propose that you participate in a new project together. This may be something you've never done before, Taurus, and you're likely to have doubts.

Just go out for dinner and act like a friend. Keep romance out of the equation for now!",

"This is a good time to get more serious about your art, Taurus.

"You may feel insecure about your appearance today, Taurus. This can be a vicious cycle, and the end result is almost always negative.

Whether it's your weight, age, or anything else, if you can't accept yourself as you are, you'll always find something wrong no matter how many changes you make.",
"Kindheartedness is wonderful, but being taken advantage of can be a danger. You really need to trust your instincts to keep this from happening.

"Be disciplined. Maintain your boundaries in order to keep from getting swept into other people's soap operas, Taurus. It may be fun to escape your problems by jumping into someone else's life, but soon you'll find the extra weight is not only taxing but also won't solve your problems. You may need to say no to others, but that's fine. It's vital that you consider your needs.",
"Mind your physical health today, Taurus. Don't push yourself if you're feeling tired and run down. Seriously consider taking a day off from everything to get the rest your body needs.

Be confident that you can handle anything.",
"If you're not already so inclined, Taurus, why not try expressing yourself through song? Even if you're convinced you have a tin ear, you might be surprised at what happens if you just let yourself go. Do you feel silly singing out loud? Then be silly. Ham it up and have some fun. Even if you're tone deaf, you'll have a great time, and that sort of feeling is infectious.",
"You might want to start a new creative project, Taurus, and several ideas may float through your head. However, you might not be able to decide which one you like the most or how to turn it into reality. Sit down and list the possibilities and then do something else. Think about it again tomorrow. It may be difficult to stay focused on anything right now.",
"While you're on a crusade for peace and diplomacy, Taurus, you may find that other people seem to be on a crusade for war. Do your best under the prevailing trends.

You have your work cut out for you today if you plan on maintaining a serene and calm disposition.",
"Today it may appear that a lot of people are arguing over very strange things, Taurus. Usually you can see both sides of a disagreement, but today you might wonder if there's any side to what you're hearing. Everyone's making mountains out of molehills. Distance yourself and don't try to mediate. You could upset everyone with your laughing!",
"Group activities could escalate almost to a frenzy. New short-term goals could necessitate a lot of work, Taurus. You might get caught in a rush of phone calls and errands.

"Today you might find it necessary to turn down an invitation to a social event, Taurus, and the host might for some reason seem offended.

That's all you can do now.",
"Just when you thought things were settled, life takes another turn. Today brings yet another of those turns, so hold on, Taurus.

One thing is clear - your future looks promising!",

"A friend may have some outrageous, unworkable ideas for making money, Taurus. No matter what they involve, you'll probably start by listening just to be polite and then end up wondering if your friend is still on this planet. This isn't a good day to get involved in anything risky. If asked, make your excuses. \"Risky\" is too mild a word for this proposal!",
"Today is a day in which you need to use logic. You could receive an unsettling and unexpected letter or phone call, perhaps involving money. The person communicating with you is probably operating under a misconception, so don't panic if it's bad news. Talk to people in a position to know the facts before moving ahead with the information. Chances are it's been garbled.",
"Money matters may seem vague today, Taurus. Uncertainty about how to manage your affairs might plague you throughout the day. Planning for the immediate future could also be difficult.

If not, Taurus, someone close to you may be, because all signs are that you might spend a lot of time now in the company of friends entertaining yourself with technology.

"You may experience writer's block in every sense of the phrase. Even if you don't consider yourself a writer, for some reason it may be difficult to get even the simplest words down on paper.

Or more than one person could ask you for advice on business matters, legal papers, investments, homework, or other intellectual concerns.

Go for a workout or clean the house. Engage in any kind of physical activity and get the endorphins going so you can feel good again. Life's too short to waste on being stressed and upset.",
"Are you experiencing a shopping hangover today? Are you worried that you outdid yourself despite your best intentions? Don't fret. You'll be back on track soon. Cash will begin flowing again and your lifestyle won't suffer. Instead of worrying about money, pay attention to your creative outlets. Follow that instinct and see where it takes you!",
"A shift in responsibilities may be needed at home. You or your partner may need more help with household tasks or want to abdicate responsibility for all the daily errands.

Be pleasant, smile, and nod, but don't ask any leading questions. Once you get them started, these people keep talking!",
"Your creativity is at a peak, though you may not be aware of it due to your focus on your work and social life. But don't be surprised if you have a vision, seemingly from out of the blue.

You're much better off setting your sights on something downstream so that you can utilize the incredible force that already has a great deal of momentum behind it. There's no need to reinvent the wheel on a day like this.",
"Celebrating coming milestones could have you running around paying visits, shopping, or consulting with others. You might have some interesting news to tell that others enjoy hearing. There might be some changes coming in your area. Perhaps new neighbors or businesses are moving in, or a get-together is planned. This promises to be a busy but satisfying day.",
"Your well-considered actions will be effective today. There's strength in your mental power. You shouldn't hesitate to direct others toward avenues that would be good for them. You have the vision to see things that other people might not notice. People may not be able to see something in front of them even if they're about to crash into it!",
"A phone call from a partner could have you suddenly playing the role of salesperson. You might have a project you want to pitch, you might need to sell your way of doing something, or you might actually have to sell a product. Whichever it is, you're likely to succeed. You're especially quick and expressive today. Your powers of persuasion are high.",
"You could have an artistic talent that you haven't yet tapped. Today events might occur that cause you to want to try. This is a good time, as your inspiration is high. Don't judge yourself too harshly if your efforts don't quite fit your expectations. Cut yourself some slack. More experience is needed before you can really fit your vision to your skill.",
"You may feel worried about your financial situation today. You may have been expecting to receive some money that's now delayed. A temporary separation from a romantic partner could have you feeling a little blue. If you keep yourself busy and don't dwell on it, time will pass quickly until you're together again. In the evening, take some time to relax.",
"Love and romance are very much on your mind today. This is a perfect day to concentrate on this part of your life, for all signs indicate that relations with romantic partners are going to be happy, stimulating, and passionate. If you aren't involved, chances are you'll meet someone. If you are, expect a wonderful evening together!",
"You may feel like a mediator between two camps, or you may be the one in a struggle that needs mediation. The big problem with the tension today is that one side could be headstrong and bound to the facts and the truth, while the other is bound to a broader perspective, not necessarily a realistic one. Facts could get twisted in all directions depending on who's delivering them.",
"In order to maintain peace and harmony, you may wear many different masks. By doing this, you may forget your inner truth and what it is you truly believe. Friction between your lively, communicative outside and your soft, vulnerable inside may make it difficult for you to find the solution you seek. You have the answers you need. Trust yourself when you find them.",
"The planetary shift will probably be imperceptible today, but you'll have several months to understand how this change impacts you. It will dawn on you that you feel a strong need for liberation. Perhaps you need to release yourself from the bonds of your group. Change and innovation are in the air!",
"Recent study of philosophical or spiritual matters might inspire you to express your insights creatively. Whether you choose to write, make music, or paint pictures, you'll notice a difference in your style. This may not last, as it's at least partially due to what's on your mind now, but make the most of it today. You might produce quality work that surprises even you.",
"Legal papers regarding money might need to be executed today. Your mind is especially quick and agile, so you can take care of it efficiently, freeing you up for more enjoyable activities, such as getting together with friends or a partner. Discussions concerning science, psychology, or the occult or metaphysical subjects could dominate your time.",
"Depressing news about the state of the world economy or stock market could have you feeling gloomy and wondering about your financial future. Don't worry. The world economy is in pretty good shape and you should be, too. Equity in property investments could be down, but they should recover shortly. Go with the flow and don't believe everything you read or hear.",
"Today you could receive an unexpected sum of money. Perhaps a friend who owes you could repay the debt, or you could get an unexpected opportunity to earn a little extra on the side. Romance should also go well, as both you and a current or potential romantic partner are feeling especially warm and sensual. Go to a favorite restaurant to celebrate your good fortune.",
"In the past few days, you may have felt somewhat frustrated in your initiatives. Either outside obstacles (such as events that caused delays) or inner restraints (such as your apathy) presented a clear challenge. Before you can make any real progress, certain matters must be resolved. The day ahead may give you an opportunity to finally settle these issues.",
"A lot of calls could come your way today. Some involve people who live far away, some are from friends with heavy emotional difficulties, and one could come from a romantic partner with whom you're very anxious to get together. You might hop in the car to meet this person somewhere familiar in your community. Don't wear your voice out talking on the phone!",
"Your mind will expand today. You'll feel like there's a ton of information crammed into your head that needs processing. Regarding big projects, try to finish them as quickly as you can. The best policy is to pace yourself. If you wait until the last minute to finish, the quality of your work will suffer. Make a plan and maybe even a timeline. Set small deadlines as you go along.",
"Love and romance are most certainly in the cards today. Play the hand you're dealt and you should come away from the table victorious. There's some transformation that may take place regarding issues of the heart. Don't compromise yourself in any way. Settle for nothing but the best. This is a day to shine.",
"You may work hard today to balance powerful forces. You may be torn between a lust for adventure and a need for communication. Either way, the bottom line is freedom to do and say the things you want. This is an important time to spread your wings despite any opposition. You can't go wrong with anything involving higher learning, religion, or spirituality.",
"Today you might seek to expand your knowledge of the arts. You could decide to explore galleries, attend a concert or play, or look into the latest best sellers. A friend could accompany you. Make a day of it! Books, antiques, or other fine objects might be especially appealing now. Try to avoid shopping. You'll discover a lot of items you like and want to buy!",
"A romantic haze surrounds love relationships. You could be thinking that your romantic partner has stepped out of a fairy tale. Yet even storybook heroes and heroines have flaws - but flaws can be endearing! Your creative energy should be very high. Artistic projects may have an otherworldly quality about them that boosts their quality and impact. Go for it!",
"The annoying restlessness that you experience today is simply a reminder that it's important to start engaging in art projects or musical endeavors that make you happy. Learn from people who aren't afraid to follow their dreams. Don't be so concerned with what other people think of your work. Now it's important to do these things for yourself.",
"Ideas for creative projects that might earn more money could buzz through your mind. There might be so many that you have to scramble to write them down so you don't forget any. Discussions with friends or your partner could give you even more ideas instead of paring down the list. Let them come for now. You can make sense of them later. What's important now is to get them in writing.",
"Have fun with people today. Talk about the fantasies you dream about coming to fruition in the coming years. Your emotions are strongly tied to your imagination. You could become defensive when someone starts to poke holes in your dreams. Use your intellect to defend yourself and the ideals you wish to live by in the future.",
"Your witty, social attitude may not be appreciated, given the emotional and sober mood of the day. You adjust your outfit to reflect current weather patterns. If you dress in silk, you won't be too happy when it rains and you have no umbrella. Consider such things when you walk into a room full of people today. What is the mood? How can you fit in with it and lift it?",
"Either way you choose, you have strength to work with, so stop agonizing over your decision. People will be like putty in your hands. Your calm, diplomatic approach calms even the most heated dispute. Make time to address the issues. Have confidence in every move you make. Don't worry if others look upon you negatively.",
"Publications could bring some fascinating new knowledge your way. You'll want to discuss it with friends. Conversations about any subject should be informative and beneficial since your mind is so perceptive and retentive. Affection for friends, relatives, and your special someone should fill your heart today. An intimate evening with your partner will be especially fulfilling.",
"A close friend or your partner could propose an impromptu trip and you might decide to go. You're restless for adventure. You may have been considering several options, but your friend's idea seems the most appealing. If this is a trip to a foreign country, you might want to study the language. You'll be surprised at how quickly you learn it!",
"Your kindness and good manners could pay off today. Someone who respects you a great deal might offer you an opportunity to advance that increases your income. You may have known this person for a long time, and the two of you work well together. This opportunity should be welcome and not intimidating. Go for it! If you do, the future will be rosy.",
"The presence of children in your home could arouse your nurturing instincts today. You might want to read to them or tell them stories. Stay away from any particularly gruesome fairy tales. The atmosphere may be a bit gloomy, and the macabre may have too powerful an effect on them and you. In the evening, plan a private, intimate evening with your special someone.",
"You may be drawn to someone because of the things you share in common. You both appreciate art, music, and romantic dinners, but this person may not be a good permanent mate for you. He or she is unwilling to take the first step, or is indecisive about important issues. If you're uninvolved now, look for someone who challenges your quick wit and isn't afraid to make the first move.",
"Important new information could come your way, perhaps through classes, books, or conversations with friends. This might open new personal and professional doors for you. You could learn new skills with technology, enhance your artistic ability, or both. Whichever you choose, this is a great day to train your talents. In doing so, you could form some powerful new friendships.",
"Uncertainty about your financial future might have you developing some sort of savings or investment plan to give you more security. You'll probably find the help you need, as today's planets show that you should succeed at anything you try. A slight malaise could cause you to turn to vitamins, herbs, yoga, or some other sort of healing method that can put you back on your feet.",
"The present planetary aspects could change your approach to life. Almost compulsively, you'll need to deepen your relationships with the people you've recently met. You'll probably be attracted to one of them, but be careful, as this person might not feel the same way about you. Look on the bright side. Why would you want to waste your energy on someone who doesn't care about you?",
"Today is great for creativity, especially the kind that shows your special style. You're productive, although what you've been creating is just a reflection of the latest fashions. This is one of your drawbacks, as it keeps you from being true to your special style. Today you should use your feelings as your inspiration.",
"Today you may receive some interesting news. It could come in the form of a call or email and will be from someone close to you. Whatever the news, it may spur you to action, necessitating lots of errands and pulling a project together quickly. You're happy, energetic, and certainly up to the task!",
"A female friend may seem to be upset with you and might not admit it. If you ask what's wrong, she'll probably say, \"Nothing.\" Use your intuition to deduce what's bothering her and then try to make it up to her in some way. You might want to reevaluate your friendship. She may be too uncommunicative. The term \"acquaintance\" might suit her better than \"friend.\"",
"This is a day to be directed inward rather than outward. It's a good thing, too, because the outer world isn't too pleasant. Nothing seems to be going right. Checks aren't arriving and calls aren't returned. You're feeling ineffective at best. Take heart. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the planets. The mood will pass. Meanwhile, do something fun by yourself.",
"Creative ideas may elude you today. You may have a hankering to do something artistic but with only a few vague notions, and you may not like those. This is a good day to work with others' ideas. Read, play music by a great composer, copy a painting by a master. This way you'll keep the impulses going without trying to force new ideas that won't come.",
"Today is good for relationships. Regardless of whether it's personal or professional, you can expect good things to happen. You may be called upon to participate in an unusual group project and strike up some potentially beautiful friendships. At home your mate may be especially thoughtful and demonstrative. You radiate an aura of love and warmth, and people respond in kind.",
"It looks like you're making headway again. Now that you're planning for the future, you could enroll in an educational program or take a trip. Don't be so dazzled by today's bright outlook that you forget the business at hand. Accept this day for what it is - a brief respite amid the chaos. Tomorrow you'll return to your work refreshed.",
"There may be a frenzy of activity around you, but you'll be able to handle it. Your charm will get you through any door. You should be able to juggle many things at once, and others will look to you for support. You'll have a level head and calm demeanor and handle things diplomatically and honestly. Don't be surprised if things get more insane as the day wears on, but this shouldn't faze you.",
"Dive deep. This isn't a day to stay in shallow waters. This is a day to go beyond your normal limits. Although there may be a great emotional charge accompanying everything you do, let this be the excitement that fuels your passion and not the reason to stop. Getting started may be tough, and you may want to spend the day in bed. Once you get going, it may be hard to slow down.",
"Today you may extend an invitation to someone close to visit you in your home, but don't count on the person being able to make it. Something may come up. Disappointment could make you melancholy, but don't let it get the better of you. Invite someone else or channel that energy into creative or artistic projects. That way you can enjoy the day anyway.",
"Other people are important to you. Today your relationships could take on even more significance than usual. You could meet some interesting people, and if you're not involved, you might even fall in love. Old and new friends could seem more wonderful and idealized. Romantic relationships could assume fairytale qualities. Try to make an effort to see people as they really are.",
"A chance to increase your income could come your way. This could involve extra work or investments. Investments involving land or other real estate could be especially profitable now. There could also be contracts or legal papers involved that bring money your way, so be prepared. The end of this year should see you more financially secure than you were at the beginning.",
"There's plenty to talk about. The hard part is finding a reason to stop talking. Once someone brings up philosophy or religion, it seems like the floodgates open. You'll be occupied for a few hours as you engage in a discussion. Your mind will jump around, and you'll be happy to consider many perspectives, although you'll have the last say about what you believe.",
"Today will start off with an energy boost for you. Seize the opportunity to make the most of this by getting those major projects and chores handled. It isn't every day that you feel this good. If you get to work right off the bat, you'll have plenty of time to do something recreational afterward. If you're into sports, the extra energy will give you quite an edge.",
"You may feel like you're spinning your wheels today, especially as the end of the day draws near. Nothing seems to be going your way. Things aren't really as bad as you think. Most likely, part of your uneasiness has to do with anticipation of upcoming events. Difficult tensions can result when you get irritable for no reason. Don't make the situation any worse than it needs to be."]
