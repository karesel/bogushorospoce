exports.arr = ["Realize that to conquer new ground you may have to make some sacrifices, Gemini. Things may not always go according to your perfect vision, but that's the natural way of things. Life should be simple and free flowing. The tangle of voices in your mind is usually the thing that makes issues and situations more complicated than they need to be. Maintain the peace and keep things easy.",
"Tension may be a bit high with everyone and everything you encounter today, Gemini. There will be a strong need for stability and discipline, while others call for fun and frivolity. You may be caught in the middle. The worst thing is that no side, including yours, is going to want to compromise. Try not to take things too seriously.",
"Your emotions may be confused today, Gemini. People may seem to rub you the wrong way, and you may feel like you're all alone in the world. Keep in mind that you're very sensitive and capable of picking up things that other people miss. You cut through the masks and see right to the core of every issue. Give yourself credit for being a passionate detective.",
"People may be extra stubborn today, so try to avoid any confrontations that could lead to full-scale war. Your emotions may feel restricted and restrained, Gemini. Don't sweat the small stuff. Realize that you're going through a trying period right now and that you need all the sanity you can muster. Refrain from making mountains out of molehills.",
"You should enjoy the intense energy of today, Gemini. The mud is finally beginning to clear away. Expose the truth in every issue and get ready for the gremlins that may be unEarthed. Connect with nature today and spend some time with animals if you can. Take deep breaths in fresh outdoor air and enjoy a long walk somewhere special with a close friend.",
"You should feel loving today toward just about anyone you like and respect. Clear communication with friends, lovers, and children could enhance your understanding of them, and vice versa. The bonds in these relationships will be strengthened, perpetuating the good feelings you've felt all year. Current bonds grow more devoted, while new ones become close. Keep the lines of communication open.",
"Does it seem like your life is pulling apart at the seams, Gemini? Perhaps it's time to reevaluate. Major aspects of your being could be coming into question and you can't seem to find the answer to why you started down this road in the first place. Have confidence in yourself and your incredible ability to cut to the core of every matter. This is just a phase and you're able to work through it.",
"Relations with neighbors, siblings, or other relatives could get a shot in the arm now, Gemini. For some, your recent business successes cause them to get on the bandwagon. For others, your personal growth could increase their admiration of you. Partnerships of any kind formed today show great promise of success. These could be business, personal, or romantic. Don't be shy. Go with the flow.",
"Arrangements for a get-together you're planning to host could go awry, with everything turned upside down and nothing happening the way you planned. This isn't going to halt your plans, Gemini, but it's going to require more effort to get things back on track and make it happen. This is going to be exasperating for you, but don't waste time moaning about it. Get busy and take care of business.",
"A scheduling conflict may come up today, Gemini. A business engagement could interfere with a social event. You might doubt whether you can attend both, but if you plan carefully, it should be OK. Someone at home might not be communicative, which could cause a little worry. This person has issues they need to work out for themselves. Just be there if needed.",
"Paperwork regarding a bonus, settlement, or dividend of some kind might need to be executed today. It will probably be boring. You will get it done. Sudden insights, revelations, or flights of fancy might provide fodder for creative activities, particularly writing or speaking. Write these ideas down. You have a good memory, Gemini, but you will want to recall every detail.",
"An old friend you haven't seen in a long time could turn up. This should be a pleasant surprise, Gemini, as you will have a lot of catching up to do. You might have good news, as you've been busy and could have come across some very exciting information. Take a walk at the end of the day or you might not be able to sleep.",
"You don't worry too much, Gemini, but today might be different. Insecurity may arise about a partnership. This might be a current or potential romantic relationship. Perhaps there has been little if any communication between you and your insecurity is coming to the forefront. Don't let fear or shyness keep you from meeting this person halfway. Your insecurities are probably unfounded.",
"You might toy with the idea of getting some kind of project or enterprise going with a close friend or love partner. If you're serious about it, Gemini, this is definitely the day to start. Any partnership formed at this time is likely to be successful and beneficial for all involved. This is even a good day to work out the terms of a legal agreement. Go for it.",
"A number of exciting people could attend a party or group meeting at your home. You're in just the right space to be a great host, Gemini, and you're likely to meet some interesting new people. Much of the conversation could focus on computers and other forms of technology or perhaps on astrology or other occult subjects. You should have a good time and learn a lot.",
"Paperwork regarding money might need attention today, Gemini, as you could be planning to entertain visitors. These are apt to be exciting people bringing good news and interesting information. You might also expect a delivery of some new books or equipment, and this should contribute to the excitement. The doors to adventure are going to open up in some way. Use this to your advantage.",
"Matters involving your community might require your attention. This is likely to involve communication in some way. Perhaps you want to make some phone calls, write letters, or place an ad or article in a local newspaper. Communication of all sorts should go well, Gemini, and you might find that it opens new doors to understanding between you and those closest to you.",
"Today you might find yourself in the public eye. Acknowledgment for work well done could come your way. It might also involve an increase in income. This could be job related or simply a community project that you've been working on and accomplished successfully. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, Gemini, even though you might find it a bit disconcerting.",
"Don't try to nail down any answers today, Gemini, because you will probably end up feeling frustrated. The less you try to force your will on others, the more you will find that things just automatically go your way. Today isn't about finding solutions to problems. It's about enjoying what you've already learned and accomplished. Keep things light.",
"Gemini, you tend to be a master psychologist. You don't need to know people well in order to accurately size them up. But today this ability could be temporarily lacking. You don't sense much from those you meet, and when you do intuit their thoughts and feelings, what you pick up isn't likely to be very accurate. Don't worry. Your mind should be back to normal tomorrow.",
"A group meeting of some sort, perhaps job related, could take place in your home today, Gemini. Whatever business the group has planned should be taken care of quickly and then you will be able to hang out and socialize. You might discover new aspects of your guests you didn't know existed. This could prove very enlightening for all concerned. Your bond with them will definitely improve.",
"Today may be an odd combination of social and financial, Gemini, likely a combination of the two in some way. Perhaps you need to meet with an attorney and end up dining together. Or you and a casual acquaintance could decide to go out for a drink. Legal documents are highlighted, so be sure to carefully look over contracts of any kind.",
"You've always been interested in the arts, and now you want to explore that interest on a deeper level. A visit to a museum isn't likely to do the trick, Gemini. Instead, why not enroll in a class or sign up for a lecture series? A few artists, in particular, capture your interest. Make it a point to concentrate on them first.",
"You may feel an urgent need to use your physical energy. This need will raise the issue of how to incorporate more exercise into your life. This would be an ideal time to join a gym. Participating in a group sports activity would be a good choice for you. Get started, no matter what outlet you choose, Gemini. Excuses won't be tolerated.",
"A rise in your income could lead to a transformation in your values, Gemini, particularly where business is concerned. You could be opening up to the vast potential for prosperity that exists now. This is definitely something you should explore. Take care that you don't lose sight of what really matters. Money is meant to enhance the other departments of life, not consume them.",
"You know you're intuitive, Gemini, but changes could take place in your brain that elevate your abilities beyond mere intuition. Visions, prophetic dreams, and powerful insights into others' thoughts and feelings could reveal you to be a gifted psychic. If you've been training your abilities, this should come as no surprise, but the level of your gifts will. You will never be the same.",
"Uninvited visitors could cause some stress, Gemini. You wanted to spend your day resting, but now you have to entertain people, and this could prove irritating. It's better to keep the visit short and sweet than feel obligated to play host when you aren't up to it. You will want to stay on good terms with your guests. Be polite but firm and then relax.",
"Your financial situation could get a strong boost today, Gemini. This might be due to a contract you've just signed, perhaps involving some work you will do on your own rather than for an employer. The project may have strong personal significance. The creative arts could be involved, as well as technology. Be prepared for a busy month, but it will be a great one. Go for the gold!",
"You may feel so confident that you could be thinking in terms of starting a new enterprise, Gemini. Partnerships are especially likely to succeed now. You could also grow closer to those who mean the most to you - family, friends, romantic partners. If you aren't currently romantically involved, you might be soon. Your new sense of self-confidence should pull more people into your circle.",
"A financial windfall might come your way, Gemini. This may not be a lottery win or surprise inheritance. It's probably something you've worked hard for, but more than you expected. As a result, you could walk around in a daze for much of the day. Don't try to make plans for it. Put it aside until you're used to the idea of having it. Only then will your practical nature kick in.",
"If you've given up on something you've lost, Gemini, you might get a real surprise tonight when a dream sheds light on where you might find it. It's important that you either get up and search for the object immediately or write the dream down in as much detail as you can remember. Otherwise, this could be one of those dreams that disappears as soon as you wake up, and you won't want that.",
"Social events involving both old and new friends could prove especially satisfying at this time, Gemini. You will be able to catch up with those you haven't seen for a while. You might also be introduced to new people who prove valuable business contacts in the future. Expect good news, stimulating conversation, and a lot of reminiscing about the past with warm and congenial companions.",
"A long-term love relationship may finally reach the point of total commitment, Gemini. Intense feelings and words of love could suddenly come from your partner, which could take you by surprise but are no less welcome for that. Talk of a future together may result, but no concrete decisions will be made. Nor should they be. Don't push it. Bask in the glow of the promise of lasting love.",
"Today you can expect to have a highly interesting conversation with someone, Gemini. The person you will be talking to is going to provide you with a ton of information that will open a whole new world of knowledge. Excitement and happiness will be with you all day. This conversation will have an impact on your future.",
"Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Gemini, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.",
"Plans for a social event that you were going to host in your home may have to be changed at the last minute. Even so, it should go very well. You're feeling exceptionally sociable now, Gemini, not to mention romantic and sexy. If you aren't presently involved, expect to meet more than one possibility. If you are involved, anticipate events that will bring you closer to your partner.",
"You might be planning or leaving on a much-needed vacation now, and feeling very excited about it. Plans should go smoothly, Gemini, so you're apt to get everything together with few glitches. Friends in distant places might ask you to visit or be planning visits of their own. The focus today is on expansion of your physical and mental horizons. Go for it, have fun, and take notes.",
"You will get the most satisfaction today through your activities with others, Gemini. So you should take the initiative and propose something you and your friends could do together. Be creative and think of something unusual, perhaps an outdoor activity like horseback riding, hiking, or an outing to an amusement park. Your friends will appreciate the thought you put into it.",
"You now seem to be able to do everything you want to do, Gemini. Things are going well as you reap the rewards of important past decisions you made. The obstacles that tended to get in your way are history now. Your family is happy and healthy. Your success is encouraging you to make plans for the future. It also enables you to look forward to much better days for you and those close to you.",
"The stars are pushing you to accept more responsibility in your life. In fact, you may not think you can do it, but everything will work out just fine. At the moment, you seem to have a special gift for leading other people, making decisions, and doing whatever is necessary to finish up group projects. It's too bad - you really underestimate yourself!",
"Social events, perhaps business related, could put you in touch with people in fascinating fields or from foreign countries, Gemini. Logical thinking and a philosophical attitude enhance your communicative gifts, so people will be drawn to you to hear what you say. You could make important contacts. Take notes. This evening could be a key turning point for your future plans.",
"Your financial situation could undergo some positive upheaval now, probably as the result of a career advance. This process is likely to continue today, Gemini, as social events put you in touch with valuable contacts. It might be a good idea to listen to others today and not try to voice ideas of your own or make any decisions. Too much input could lead to mental overload and a lack of focus.",
"Like a team of pickpockets in a crowd, a group may have its eyes on you and secretly scheme to take advantage of your innocence, Gemini. One may work to distract you with something playful and harmless, while the others work behind your back to secretly steal your valuables. Stay aware of yourself and your belongings at all times.",
"Secure your emotions and make sure you're set in your mind before you take action today, Gemini. This is a terrific time to get things started. Following through to completion shouldn't be a problem. The difficult part is taking that first step. This can be easily done on a day like today, so don't miss this opportunity when your intuitive sense is extra keen.",
"Worries about a household member could plague you today, Gemini. This person might have gone away without telling anyone, or seem upset. Your friend is probably OK but at odds with someone outside the household rather than in it. Let this person work it out in whatever way they see fit. Your companion will share with you when the time is right.",
"Annoyances of daily life may rub you the wrong way today, Gemini. Other people's strong opinions and odd quirks may be difficult to swallow and your fuse may be a bit shorter than usual. Emotions could also run high, and you may do battle with the feelings in your own heart. Perhaps someone you care about deeply is creating unnecessary friction in your relationship.",
"Money matters may be advanced through using your intuition and inner power today, Gemini. You might have a hunch that your idea for making extra money might just work. Look into it at least. Don't let anyone talk you out of it until you know the facts. You might also rediscover a long-neglected talent that you find useful now.",
"A partner might be feeling rather down and need you to cheer him or her up, Gemini. Too many social invitations could come your way today. You may have to turn one of them down. You may not be in the mood for socializing and need to be alone to organize your thoughts. One of the events could be business related and you may feel obligated to go. Put in an appearance. Don't feel compelled to stay long.",
"Your psychoanalytical talents could be put to work today when misunderstandings come up. Your friends aren't likely to be thinking clearly and may not respond to reassurances, Gemini. Use your intuition to determine the best way to defuse the situation. Finances might cause some worry now, but your ingenuity and fiscal sense should put things right. Go out and have a good time tonight.",
"A long-awaited social event, perhaps a wedding or christening, could move you to tears, Gemini. As you're naturally a person who doesn't like showing your feelings, you might feel the need to get away until the urge to cry has passed. This should be a very happy day for you as well. Your own contentment could seem almost too good to be true. It's real. Relax and enjoy it.",
"Bite the bullet and get it done, Gemini. Finish the projects and get the lingering odds and ends out of your way. There are stable energies today that will bring a practical breath of fresh air to any situation. Take a step back from the swirling winds and observe your inner self. Realize how your actions and emotions affect others and think about adjusting your habits accordingly.",
"The words for today are \"romance\" and \"creativity,\" Gemini. Romance is enhanced by passion generated by a gratifying love relationship that will probably last for a long time. This same relationship, and its emotions could give rise to artistic inspiration that can produce works of a quality that surprises even you. Don't exhaust yourself. Know when to stop.",
"This isn't the day to make investments, Gemini. You may read in the paper or online about some hot new stocks, but be very careful. If you're interested, consult a professional before investing money. Even after you've talked to an expert, it's still a good idea to wait a day or two before you make the investment. Any hot tips you receive today could be rather doubtful. Be patient.",
"Jealousy might rear its head today, Gemini. The key to it all is to understand where and why you feel insecure. If you're jealous of a mate, what's going on in the relationship? Is trust an issue? If this comes up at work, is it because you don't feel recognized for your contributions? Examine the cause of jealousy. It's almost always a symptom of a deeper problem.",
"Your nature is intense, Gemini. You probably feel things deeply and spend a lot of time lost in thought. Yet, too much intensity can take a toll on your health and well-being. It might be time to go out and enjoy yourself. Get up from the chair and take a walk. Meet someone for lunch or do a little shopping or yoga. Find something active to do to break the monotony of your routine.",
"Don't be surprised if someone describes you as conservative, Gemini. It may be true. It could indicate that it's important for you to maintain control over most things - what you say and how much, how you dress, the kinds of people you spend time with, where and how you spend your money - these are all things that conservative people tend to closely monitor. Be proud of who you are.",
"Today may bring up strong feelings, Gemini. This may not be new, as you have a tendency to feel things deeply. But it may be a bit tough to find a way to express this. While you're creative, finding the right activity to get you going isn't always easy. Why not visit a bookstore and look for some appealing craft books or art materials? This might spark ideas for new ways to express yourself.",
"Make your dreams a tool for gaining insight, Gemini. In the past, some rulers believed that their dreams held great insights and they employed people to interpret them. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights or random brainwaves, there is much to be gained. Recurring dreams hold significance. They can point to something that you need to take care of. Consider exploring this area.",
"If you've been feeling sluggish lately, Gemini, today will see a surge in energy that will greatly increase your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to get into the fresh air for a sports activity or long walk. Exercise can direct your physical energy and give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you discover more clarity and focus afterward. Make the most of it.",
"Today is an ideal day to shop for a new wardrobe. You may find your usual style too conventional or uncomfortably trendy. Sometimes you reject outfits you really like out of fear they're too suggestive, old fashioned, or something else. Perhaps you should listen to your good judgment for a change instead of being so concerned about what other people might think.",
"A number of people involved in the healing professions could cross your path today, Gemini. You might hear news about recent discoveries in those fields that sparks your interest. What you learn could affect your life in a profoundly positive way, so you need to write down not only the contact information for the people you meet but also the resources they use.",
"There could be a great deal of friction in your world today, Gemini, as stubborn minds aggressively come into conflict with each other. Be careful how you treat others, because feelings are likely to be hurt if you're insensitive. Others may look tough, but deep down they're just as soft as you are. Think twice about using your aggressive nature at the expense of others.",
"The more tightly you try to hang onto something, Gemini, the more likely it is it will want to slip through your fingers. Grab what you want, but don't squeeze too hard. Maintain an important balance between showing someone you care by taking them under your wing and allowing them the freedom to be their own person. Sensitive feelings are operating today, so proceed with care.",
"You could complete some personal projects that involve a lot of paperwork today, Gemini. This could increase your income considerably. Past success that has become known in your field could lead to opportunities for future success. This may be job related, but it may also involve your own projects. All signs indicate that success, good fortune, and advancement are in the wind for you.",
"Recent new ideas, insights, and visions could motivate you to invite friends with similar interests over today, Gemini. You will want to share your experiences, listen to their stories, and try to make sense of it all. This may be an important process, even if some of what's said doesn't seem to make sense. Write down your thoughts and go over them later.",
"Sudden, positive changes in your financial condition could come your way. This could be an increase in income or involve some kind of windfall. Whichever it is, it's going to make a difference in your life. You could also discover a hidden talent that you were previously unaware of. It could also set you off on a different life path. Don't be afraid, Gemini. Go for it!",
"You may but heads with someone who's equally unwilling to budge, Gemini. Use this conflict as a lesson in perspective. Understand the motivation of the opposite side. The life lesson you may need to learn probably has to do with discipline and the need for honest sweat from your brow. Don't be afraid to work a little harder than you have been to make your dreams come true.",
"Don't take no for an answer today, Gemini. Chances are you won't have to. People will be more understanding of your situation and have compassion for your cause. Your inner strength will show through loud and clear, and you have the desire to make anything happen you want. There's a lucky star smiling on you that's helping you tackle any project.",
"Generally you're pretty emotionally stable, Gemini. Today's events might seem to conspire to create erratic moods that you aren't used to feeling. No major concerns should arise, but little irritations like dropping things, misplacing keys, or missing calls could get on your nerves. Slow down and stay focused. It's the only way you will remain calm today.",
"Frustrating delays in completing a project might cause you to doubt your skills, Gemini. Be careful not to fall into this trap. There's nothing wrong with your skills. Take a good long look at what you're doing and try to discern where it got hung up. Worries about money may cause you to consider postponing an activity that means a lot to you. Don't. Use your ingenuity to work it out.",
"You may feel a little unsure of what you believe in now, Gemini. Your mind is filled with questions and contradictions. Try to realize that the journey to finding your true purpose could take a lifetime. No one else expects you to have all the answers right now, so why should you? Relax and try and enjoy moments spent with your loved ones. You may find that this is really all you need.",
"Some strange but wonderful things could be happening to you now, Gemini. Sheer luck could well be in the picture. Have you wanted to move to a nicer place? If so, now you probably can. Have you been expecting a bonus or settlement? Today it could be yours! Even your dreams are apt to be vivid, powerful, and very beautiful. The only downside is if one of the events involves money, don't overspend!",
"Your artistic talents could be put to good use today fixing up wherever it is that you work on, Gemini. You might want to repaint, put up new plants or pictures, or do anything else that makes the place seem a little more dressed up. This isn't just fun. Both the process of doing it and the end result should lift your mood and keep you stimulated for the next few days. Have fun!",
"All matters related to romance, love, and marriage should go well today, Gemini. You should feel especially warm and supportive. Intimate conversations will come easily and naturally. Be sure to think before you speak. There's some danger of misunderstanding, and you don't want any arguments to upset this glorious day.",
"Some young visitors may come to your home today, Gemini. You could unexpectedly find yourself called upon to entertain them. You don't usually like to be the center of attention, but on this occasion you might enjoy it. You could direct some games or tell a story or two. Whatever you do, both you and your guests should have a great time. Enjoy your day.",
"Have you been working very hard to increase your income? If so, Gemini, results might finally manifest. More available income usually necessitates working even harder, but in your case, you might be able to relax for a while and thus rid yourself of all the stress and tension that's been building up. Thank your lucky stars, and make plans for your free time.",
"Deep thought that occupies your time today could lead to some fascinating conversations with a close friend or partner, Gemini. Lots of deas and useful information could be discussed and lead to new projects, perhaps involving writing or teaching. You will want to research every possible contingency before making definite plans, so get busy. You don't want to pass up a lucrative opportunity.",
"Home and technology figure prominently today, Gemini. Perhaps you've just bought the latest gadget and want to spend the day figuring out how it works. You're in your element! A phone call from a distant friend could interrupt your project. You may speak for a long time, but you won't mind the delay at all. It's wonderful to talk to old friends.",
"Check and double-check any information that comes your way today, Gemini. There's deception and discontent in the air, which is an unfortunate combination under any circumstances. Research before you judge. Gossip is likely to fly around the office. Run for cover when necessary. You don't want to get involved in this particular round of office politics.",
"Events beyond your control may necessitate repairs to your home or yard, and some may seem overwhelming, Gemini. Don't panic! Put your good sense to work and shop around for the best possible deal, or find a way to do it yourself. You might discover that whatever needs repair could be in better shape afterward. This could produce desirable results in the long run.",
"Increased enthusiasm for your favorite project may take you in a new direction, Gemini. You could even decide to change careers in order to devote yourself more fully to doing what you've discovered you love the most. Your physical, emotional, and spiritual health should be very good right now. Your quality of life is likely to be improving. Go with the flow.",
"This day will be filled with many exciting surprises for you, Gemini. Approach it with gratitude and you will be amazed at the number of things that just naturally seem to flow your way. Your generous heart will be rewarded in unexpected ways. Old friends are likely to show up. Open yourself up to conversations. Act spontaneously and with a great deal of passion.",
"You're becoming much more perceptive, Gemini. At the same time, your psyche and unconscious knowing are also more acute. You may find that you know more about the way someone feels than that person does. More than likely, this sort of perspective is causing you to want to take aggressive action in order to shake people up and help them open their own eyes to the situation at hand.",
"A letter or call from a relative could result in the prospect of an unexpected houseguest. You might be in a quandary as to what to do about it, Gemini. Your schedule could be crammed with other responsibilities. Don't feel pressured into making any decisions today. Think about it for a day or so and list your options. Consider them all and then make your decision.",
"Increased communication with a close friend or lover, more on a subtle than verbal level, could bring you closer and enrich your relationship. Quiet time spend together today could generate a new sense of closeness. Images and ideas that come from deep within you can contribute to your creative self-expression. Write down any insights so you can refer to them later. Work from the heart.",
"Today is a terrific day for you, Gemini. You finally seem to have a grasp on your thought processes and inner emotions. You will feel extra sensitive and loving, and people will be drawn to you because of it. You're able to look at your feelings in a rational, levelheaded manner instead being at the mercy of your wildly fluctuating emotions.",
"Nothing is too hot for you to handle, but why do you insist on burning your hand when you don't have to, Gemini? Are you trying to prove to someone that you can take the heat without being affected by it? You can get burned just as easily as anyone else even if you deny it. Do things for you and not to prove something to other people, especially when it comes to matters of love and romance.",
"You may be tempted to make up your own rules, Gemini, because you really aren't happy with the ones before you. Be careful of doing so without first understanding the full implications for you and the people around you. By all means, if you feel like certain things just aren't right, take steps to change them. There's no reason that you have to stay within traditional constraints.",
"Unexpected visitors could wake you up to the possibility of new work opportunities, Gemini. This could advance your current job or be work you can do on your own - maybe on a volunteer basis. Whatever it is, you will probably find it exciting. You might even be impatient to get on with it. Pace yourself. If you tire yourself out, you won't be able to continue.",
"You may feel like the smallest issue is suddenly a life or death situation, Gemini. Depending on your mood, you may think you're on the brink of complete disaster, but the next minute be soaring high in the clouds. The drama that surrounds you is more a product of your reaction to your environment rather than the environment itself.",
"You may not necessarily approve of the behavior of the people around you, Gemini, but that doesn't mean you need to make their lives miserable. Be more accepting of others. Don't feel like you need to teach people a lesson simply because you don't understand their ways of life. You may be jumping to conclusions without taking the time to understand the situation.",
"You may feel a little out of sorts today, Gemini. Perhaps you indulged a bit too much last night. However, some exciting phone calls at midday might perk you up, perhaps good news from a friend or colleague. A change in your financial state is definitely indicated, as is the resulting boost to your self-esteem. All looks wonderful for you in the months to come!",
"Don't be surprised if someone rubs you the wrong way today, Gemini. It's likely that pressure has been building in other people's minds for quite some time. They might have been afraid to share their feelings before simply because they were too intimidated to say anything that might cross you. The molten lava has finally gotten hot enough and the volcano is about to erupt.",
"You may wonder why it is that you can gain control of so many parts of your life, but nothing seems to go right when it comes to romance? Dismiss the notion that you're unworthy of love. Don't try to portray yourself as someone you're not. Perhaps you're confusing the people around you by projecting an image that's completely different from who you really are.",
"If communication has been difficult for you in the past, Gemini, today you may find things a bit different. You may have a deeper understanding of the motives of others, making it easier for you to deal with them. Your intuitive abilities are operating at a high level, so you're likely to form new bonds based on what you sense about others. Celebrate tonight! You need the lift.",
"Get out of the doldrums and enjoy life, Gemini. The situation is such that if you remain stagnant for a little while, you will soon sink into a spiral of depression and downward thinking. If you stay afloat and focused on your dreams, you will remain active in your pursuit of all your life's goals. You will have the power of the Universe behind you, supporting you all the way.",
"Don't act like you have all the answers today, Gemini. This attitude will get you nowhere. Remember that everyone you encounter has something to teach you, so don't disregard that homeless person on the street. The looks you exchange with a stranger may make or break your attitude for the afternoon. Maintain a positive demeanor instead of a sour one and you will be quite successful.",
"You may feel tension in your world today without really knowing why, Gemini. This feeling of conflict may have your stomach in knots, making it difficult to deal with anything or anyone in a rational manner. Try not to take everything personally when people disapprove of your actions. Their reaction is to your behavior, not necessarily to you as a person.",
"A group you're associated with but have been neglecting may be on your mind today. You might want to fulfill your obligations to it. You could also consider completing a long-term project that was put on hold over the past week or so. Tying up loose ends may take up much of your time today and keep you busy, Gemini. Don't forget to take a little time for yourself. You are your first priority!",
"Sudden positive developments regarding the family could make a big difference to your future if you make the most of them, Gemini. A family member could have a lucky break of some kind and need your support. You might be in the right place at the right time to meet the right person. These things can be wonderful, but they're fleeting. Take advantage of them now or they will disappear.",
"Career matters might prove frustrating today, Gemini. You're aiming for a specific goal of some kind that you're anxious to reach, but it seems to hit one setback after another. Hang in there! Persevere and keep pushing. Whatever it is you're trying to attain, you will get there. It's just going to require considerably more time and effort than you originally thought. Keep on pushing!",
"Today you should be asking yourself a lot of important questions, Gemini. The Universe is pushing you on your journey of self-discovery. If you resist, you aren't going to be in a very good mood. You might want to facilitate this period with yoga or meditation. You may start a dream journal. Try to listen to yourself intuitively. You will probably find out that you already have the answers.",
"A memory, dream, vision, or meditation could trigger a rush of spiritual energy, Gemini. As a result, you might want to jot your experiences down so you won't forget them. Try not to dwell on it too much. This isn't the time to be reclusive! The process won't stop. The insights should continue to come. Keep up your studies and meditation and you will go on growing indefinitely.",
"Don't be surprised if you get a sudden windfall today, Gemini. It may come in the form of cash. More likely it will be an opportunity of some kind. Perhaps a business partner has suggested you branch into a more lucrative area. Perhaps you decide to go into business for yourself. Whatever it is, you're bound to succeed. From business and creative standpoints, this is a most auspicious time for you.",
"It's bad enough having too many cooks in the kitchen, but when those cooks argue not only about how to cook the meal but also about how to design the kitchen, you know you have trouble on your hands. Tempers are likely to flare today. Everyone has an opinion about how you should decorate your home. Whoever pays the mortgage gets to make the final decisions. That should settle it.",
"An unexpected event might cause you to be temporarily separated from your partner today, Gemini. Confusion about the incident and your mate's role in it might plague you. You might doubt his or her motives. If so, it may be best to talk and clear up any suspicions. Letting such thoughts sit for even a short time can create challenges for a relationship. Deal with the situation now.",
"If you had to score your life right now, it would have to be a perfect ten. You look great, your career is going well, and your domestic life is harmonious. Could there be anything more to life? Don't think so. You may receive news of more success at work when an important sale comes through or a project is successfully completed. You have much to celebrate, Gemini!",
"A family member may be absent without explanation, Gemini. This might worry everyone, and not without reason. It's best to stay calm and phone friends, colleagues, and anyone who might know where this person is. All is probably well. Your family member has probably been preoccupied and neglected to let anyone at home know what's going on. Hang in there!",
"A desire to make a big purchase might tempt you to overextend your credit cards and clean out your savings, Gemini. You aren't usually one to act on impulse, so don't do it today. Make the purchase if you really feel you need it and it isn't going to cause any major setbacks in your financial situation. That way your pleasure in the item won't be offset by guilt.",
"The more you try to control others, the harder it will be to get what you want, Gemini. People with equally strong wills are making it known they won't be bullied by your manipulative behavior. If a straightforward approach doesn't work, let it be. Perhaps the situation wasn't meant to develop the way you wanted. Trust that things will work out for the best whether or not you get your way.",
"There may be subtle messages in people's words today that you need to attend to, Gemini. Other people could be trying to send you hints in order to push your buttons. Confront them on this behavior. Don't ignore the subtleties in their voices. Tender, loving messages may be laced with thorns intended to provoke you. Don't let this action go unnoticed.",
"Today may seem like one of those days in which everyone but you has a perfect life, Gemini. Realize that no one has a perfect life. Everyone is plagued by demons of some sort. And it isn't wise to compare yourself to others anyway. The more you do, the more you simply set yourself up for failure. Find that sense of love and fulfillment within yourself.",
"Take control of your power today, Gemini. Strip any excess baggage out of your life. Things are coming to a critical climax now. This isn't a time to back down. If anything, it's a time to push the limits even further. Look to the future with the same perspective you had as a child. Rid yourself of jaded thinking and a clouded mind.",
"A business enterprise with a friend might seem a little shaky today, Gemini. You could alternate between enthusiasm and gloom regarding this project. It's probably a good one and could lead to the success you want. Don't make any negative judgments about its future based on what happens today. All should be progressing again within a few days. Hang in there!",
"Some long-awaited recognition could come your way today, Gemini. You're finished with the hassles you've experienced recently and have now entered a calmer period. Those who could only criticize before can't find enough words to praise you. Take the compliments at face value. There's nothing wrong with being happy with yourself.",
"You may be a bit unclear about your professional direction today, Gemini. Your motivation has disappeared without warning. What happened? It may be that you need to become involved in projects that have more universal resonance. Projects of a narrow scope that concern only your interests no longer hold your attention.",
"Whether or not you're artistic, Gemini, inspiration for music, painting, writing, or other creative projects could come to you thick and fast today. Write down your ideas. There could be so many you may not be able to remember them all. You will definitely want to draw upon them later. At least one could involve a new business enterprise with a partner. Take notes and do your research.",
"Your aesthetic sense may increase, Gemini, leading to the discovery of an artistic talent you may not have known you had. You could decide to develop this talent, possibly by enrolling in a class. A current or potential love partner might decide to come with you, creating a new venue for bringing you closer together. This should prove very exciting.",
"A dip in the stock market might cause you to worry about your own financial future, Gemini. You may have some investments that could be temporarily negatively affected. Bear in mind that such events don't necessarily reflect future trends. Take steps to create some kind of safety net if you wish, but don't assume the worst. The market could go back up tomorrow!",
"Today is a good day to join a group that shares your interests, Gemini. You will find comfort in numbers, as well as some real intellectual stimulation that comes from discovering new things with like-minded people. You may have an interest in family history. If you join a genealogy group, you could learn how to trace your roots and make friends at the same time.",
"You're at risk of feeling emotionally overwhelmed today. Don't worry, Gemini, it will all work out. Take some deep breaths and apply your intellect to the situation. Prioritize and organize. You will find that steadily and systematically you can conquer your obligations. Take time off to pay attention to your family. You deserve some quality time.",
"Something you feel you desperately need right now is missing, Gemini, and it's very well hidden. You may search the house for it and drive yourself crazy in the process. Do you really need it that badly? If so, sit for a moment and try to collect your thoughts. If you can't, leave it for now. You may find it by chance or through a sudden insight. Relax and hang in there!",
"If you feel slighted today, Gemini, don't shut yourself off from the situation. It may seem like everyone has ganged up and turned against you. Either that, or they all want to be your best friend. Things are always extreme for you, with no in-between. The slightest action from someone else can cause turmoil in your mind unless you learn to control your emotions. Make it a goal.",
"Innovative art forms might seem especially appealing today, Gemini. Stay out of gallery shops unless you're prepared to take home a carload of merchandise. If you're more into music, you might break the bank downloading tunes to your MP3 player. This could be a new phase in your artistic tastes or it could be a longstanding trend. Whichever it is, have fun!",
"A family member may withdraw from you, Gemini. This person appears to be going through a private emotional crisis and isn't apt to confide in you now. Your inclination could be to push it, but this could be a mistake. Give him or her the chance to share with you when the time is right. Sometimes we need to work things out for ourselves. Be patient.",
"A treasured possession might be missing somewhere in the house today, Gemini. No matter where you look, you won't be able to find it. This could stimulate your determination, and you might end up searching for hours. The object is in the house, but it's probably under something, perhaps in a place you would never dream of looking. Check the biggest rooms in the house.",
"You may be privy to some important knowledge, Gemini. Perhaps an article gives you the impetus you need to invest in a promising stock. Perhaps you learn a famous person is coming to town to give a lecture. If your heart starts to race the minute you hear the news, this should be all the motivation you need to take the next steps. Good things are bound to come your way if you do.",
"Your ship comes in, Gemini. Don't be surprised if you find a big, fat check waiting for you. Who knows what you've done to deserve such kindness? Don't question your good fortune - just accept it with charm and grace. Finally, you can implement some of those home improvements. Take full advantage of the generosity of the Universe. Deep down, you know you deserve it!",
"Don't underestimate the power of other people today, Gemini. They may seem flighty and scatterbrained on the outside, but underneath you will find that they have a great deal of wisdom to share. It might take some probing on your part to draw this wisdom out, but once you do, the outpouring of information will richly reward you.",
"Today an article or TV show may set your mind spinning in the strangest directions. You could finally acknowledge your fascination with the occult, or perhaps discover an interest in dream interpretation. Let yourself indulge in your interests. Sometimes you don't take the time to pursue subjects that you don't deem \"serious.\" Go ahead and explore your dark side!",
"Physical pleasure may be at the top of your priority list today, Gemini. You might want to go to your favorite restaurant and have a great meal, including wine, appetizers, and dessert. Or you might feel especially energetic and want to take your partner for a complete spa treatment. Whatever your desires, exercise some restraint You can get too much of a good thing!",
"You've been working especially hard lately, Gemini, and today you may begin to reap the benefits of all your hard work. Some project that's dear to your heart may be nearing completion, and even you are impressed by the results! All those naysayers who said it would never work are now looking at you with admiration and respect. Give yourself a pat on the back for your accomplishment.",
"Today is meant for socializing and connecting, Gemini. Your creativity is at an all-time high, so also try to work in some quiet time where you can do some writing or painting. If friends invite you out in the evening, by all means, take them up on the offer. You may meet someone who could be pivotal to your career. Be open to all possibilities.",
"You may be asking certain questions about your feelings, Gemini. Do you know about the trap that many people get caught up in - feeling so close to their partners that they often forget themselves? Sometimes it's easy to confuse your feelings with this kind of self-denial. Today you need to think about how this affects your life.",
"You have some very urgent desires, but they remain a secret to everyone else. In solitude, you cultivate your interest in philosophy and mysticism. Today, it's as if you're absent from the world. Your body and actions are in the real world, but you have gone so far into yourself that it will be hard for people around you to get you out! What incredible concentration!",
"A small amount of money might come your way today, Gemini. It could be a gift, dividend, or bonus. You may want to squander it on gifts for yourself and others rather than put it to more practical use, which is perfectly fine! Books may be especially appealing, particularly those on new spiritual or metaphysical ideas. Set some time aside for a little reading.",
"Today you might receive some uncomfortable intuitive signals from one or more of your friends, Gemini. Perhaps someone doesn't feel well but came out to play anyway. Sensing the tension in others could save you some grief, as people may be stressed and likely to lash out over nothing. It's best to focus on solitary pursuits if you can.",
"You could be a situation in which you have to make a decision about a relationship, Gemini. Perhaps old demons have come back to haunt you about your freedom, and now you have doubts. Don't listen to the doubts, because if you do, you may regress ten paces in your emotional life. Roll the dice and decide.",
"Do you have some drawings in a drawer, Gemini? Since last month, or possibly before, you've been thinking about your creative ability. You have a habit of turning your back on your skills, whether in drawing, photography, or writing, but they're in you nonetheless. People will expect more of you! All you have to do is take out a brush or pen and you will be on your way.",
"You have an excellent day ahead, Gemini. It's likely to open new horizons for you at a time when the future may have seemed bleak. If old issues related to your family resurfaced some time ago, they may be resolved in a surprising way today. In any case, this is an ideal opportunity to seek answers from your ancestors.",
"There are days when a little humility can be good for you, Gemini, and this might be one of those days. It's as if the planets are talking to you about sincerity and taking you far away from the trappings of superficiality and popularity. The things that are important to you today are much deeper concepts of humanity and compassion.",
"Is it possible you're too demanding, Gemini? Today's planetary aspects may be asking you this question. You're choosy about the people you spend time with, and you have a tendency to ask them to go too far for you. Sometimes you have trouble knowing your limits where other people are concerned. You might want to think about this.",
"Upsets and disappointments on the part of a family member could have the household in an uproar. Problems with household equipment could throw a monkey wrench into everyone's routine. On days like this, it's best for everyone to get out and distract themselves. Movies, sporting events, and museums can help relieve the stress.",
"It's time to stop acting like you think others want to see you act, Gemini. The planetary configuration confirms that it's time to express yourself - your emotions, desires, and point of view - to take a firmer stand and define more clearly who you are to others and to yourself. Second-guessing potential reactions will ultimately get you nowhere.",
"Minor ailments may awaken a new determination to improve your health. You feel especially energetic today, Gemini, so you might go to the gym. Just don't overdo it. You might also be considering several changes you'd like to make in your home or workplace. Give them careful thought before moving ahead.",
"If you're experiencing emotional upheaval, Gemini, you may take heart in knowing that other people are going through their own emotional turmoil as well. You will know that you aren't alone in your quest for emotional stability. Share your feelings with others instead of shutting them up inside. It will help you feel better.",
"This is an expansive time for you. You can make great progress on your goals, Gemini. The key is to clear up any miscommunication or dishonesty before you move forward with a clear conscious. Don't even bother trying to make progress before you've cleared up past cobwebs. Keeping everything on a light, flexible track will help you work more efficiently.",
"You may be running into obstacles associated with your goals. You may feel you aren't getting the support and cooperation you deserve. Today you may sense that people are emotionally distant, with shallow views on certain issues. People you expected to be on your side may turn against you, making you feel betrayed. Try not to take things personally.",
"Some minor but annoying communications could interrupt your routine today. You won't appreciate the distraction, Gemini, but it's best to take care of whatever it is and then go back to your tasks. You might have to spend part of the day running errands. Traffic might have you frazzled. Spend the evening relaxing at home. You've worked hard and you deserve it!",
"Confidence and efficiency are the day's themes. Do you long to bring your romantic involvement to the next level? Do you wish your partner would consent to a more profound commitment? You can take advantage of the energy from today's aspects to give your future a gentle nudge in the right direction, Gemini.",
"You're likely to experience a day of thoughtfulness and reflection, Gemini. Your state of mind will resemble that of a person who has just rebelled against everything and is now in search of a new vehicle for self-fulfillment. Others seem to be trying to exert pressure on you. Will you yield or will you listen to your inner voice? You will know the answer by the end of the day!",
"Disconcerting developments in the lives of family members could cause some stress at home. There could be some problems with the structure of the house itself. Perhaps the plumbing or electricity needs attention. If a family member is upset, Gemini, keep the lines of communication open. If there are problems that need attention, get them out of the way now.",
"The day may be somewhat oppressive, Gemini. It's possible you will receive some unpleasant news related to your domestic life. Perhaps in the past few years you haven't been especially careful about your home budget. Or you may have postponed an important maintenance task for too long. While this may not be the day the roof literally falls in, it's time to take care of repairs.",
"Gemini, today's your chance to stand up to family members who want to exert too much control over your love life. It's time to bang your fist on the table and say, \"Enough's enough, I'll love who I want to.\" When you insist that well-meaning relatives respect your choices, you'll tap into a new well of self-respect.",
"This is the beginning of a new cycle, Gemini. There will be new issues cropping up over the next several days. You may have to rethink certain principles that you've adhered to in your relationships up until now. Upon reflection, you find that you no longer agree with them. It seems that the conventions and social graces required by society are weighing you down.",
"You might have visitors, Gemini, or even a hot date scheduled for tonight. By midafternoon you might feel too tired to go out and wonder if you should cancel. It's best to keep your activities low-key. Have coffee and cake at home instead of going out, and get the cake from a bakery! Your evening should be full of exciting, stimulating conversation. You'll be glad you stuck with your plans.",
"Spiritual passion is tempered by romantic desire today, Gemini, and you're likely to want to pursue both. Perhaps your romantic partner is as spiritually inclined as you, and you both aspire to the same ends. Much of the passion you feel wells up from deep within. If you're in any way creatively inclined, you may want to memorialize these feelings through writing, painting, or music.",
"You're apt to feel a bit wilder today, Gemini. There's a wave of powerful energy working to strengthen your ego and self-confidence. Use this boost to the best of your ability. You will need it. There is a strong, fact-oriented force working to combat your aims, and you will find that it's equally powerful and stubborn. Cut through the fantasy and uncover the truth.",
"Why do so many relationships seem to come with built-in booby traps, Gemini? Today you may get a particularly pressing demand from someone in your family to give of your time or money. You're unwilling to part with either at the moment. You aren't going to let your emotions choose for you for once. Hold onto your convictions and don't let others influence your decisions!",
"If conflict arises in your world, Gemini, you must keep in mind that there is no one else to blame except you. Keeping your sights set on one goal is useful as you concentrate all your energy toward that one thing. At the same time, you may be losing perspective on what's going on around you. Make sure you continue to be a team player by keeping an eye out for the people in the wings.",
"You're terrific at following through with projects, Gemini, but perhaps not so great at starting them. Today is the perfect time for you to prove this theory wrong. There's a great deal of force out there to help you boost your rocket off the launching pad. Take advantage of this energy and get to work on things you've been meaning to start but haven't gotten around to yet.",
"The astral energy says there's a time for everything. We tend to repeat certain tasks we like doing, while those we dislike we try to get out of the way as quickly as possible. It seems reasonable, but the Universe reminds you that you should make as much space in your life for what you don't like as for what you do, because each task is related to the other in some way.",
"In a philosophical or political conversation, you don't hesitate to offer your thoughts, Gemini. Your examples may be extreme, but your principles are sound. You may get in over your head before you know it and suddenly need an escape route. Your first reaction may be to change the subject. It's better to admit you don't know the answer or don't understand the question.",
"Your dreams are more than just random firings of neurons, Gemini. They can indicate unresolved issues, stress, deep desires, and lost memories. They can prove instrumental to understanding yourself and solving problems. Keep a dream journal and you can access the power within your subconscious and all you can learn from it. Examine your recent dreams. See if there's something you need to recognize.",
"As much as you try to explain things, Gemini, others simply aren't going to see them with your same intensity and do-or-die urgency. Be careful that you don't contrive a series of far-out stories that only partially reflect the truth. Make sure the picture you paint is accurate or else others may lose faith in your judgment.",
"You may be a bit unclear about your professional direction today, Gemini. Your motivation has disappeared without warning. What happened? It may be that you need to become involved in projects that have more universal resonance. Projects that concern only your interests or that are of narrow scope no longer hold your attention.",
"You may find it hard to sit still today, Gemini. People may pull your chain right and left in order to get a rise out of you. Whatever seems grounded and solid may end up being flimsy and detached. Beware of where you step. The ground is apt to give way with little warning. Your appetite may be ravenous, but it's likely there won't be nearly enough nourishment to satisfy you.",
"Today heralds the beginning of a very agreeable period. You will be especially happy, Gemini! You will project confidence, clarity, and charisma wherever you go. You used up a lot of your reserves during the last few months. You've made it to this stage just in time. Certainly you'll agree that this is something to be celebrated!",
"Nothing seems to be clicking the way you want, Gemini. Your rational mind tells you that things are fine and you have the green light to proceed with your plans. But there's a small voice inside you that's suggesting otherwise. Perhaps you have an inkling that your plan is flawed in some way. Perhaps you're ignoring a certain pain in your heart by keeping it secret when in reality you need to let it out.",
"Have fun today and don't be so serious about anything, Gemini. This is a good time to lay low and enjoy the scenery. Go to a movie or see a play. Go to a party and celebrate. Dress up in your most attractive garb and go in for the kill. This is a day to be talkative, lighthearted, and social. Heavy emotional issues will only weigh down the positive mood.",
"Focus on your creative mind today, Gemini. This is a fertile time to plant seeds that will surely grow up healthy and strong. You have the ability to be prosperous now, but it won't come easily. The key for you now is to stay cool. Don't overreact to the little annoyances that come your way. You're beyond petty squabbles. Don't waste your time with them.",
"Today you may have difficulty connecting with others, Gemini. People may be unnecessarily harsh for no reason. Try not to get too emotionally worked up over any slights. Keep a safe distance between you and the drama around you. The next step you take might send you into quicksand, so make sure there's a good friend nearby to pull you out.",
"There may be a great deal of opposition in your way today, Gemini, but try not to dwell on it. The key is to stay levelheaded and maintain a positive outlook. This is a day in which you can bring a great deal of balance to issues by understanding and respecting the other side. Have charity for those who are making sacrifices so that you may have a more comfortable ride.",
"If you meet someone new today, Gemini, break him or her in gradually. Don't spill all the beans at once. Let the person warm up to your intense emotional nature before you unleash it full force. People are going to need their space, so make sure you allow enough room for emotional and physical freedom. Think about taking a long trip or short vacation of some sort.",
"If anyone is capable of dealing with the intense emotional energy of today, it's you, Gemini. Other people may be angry and unable to stomach the sensitive issues that may arise. Take care, since there may be some major opposition coming at you that disrupts your plans. You will face a practical, grounding force that questions your methods of operation. Use these lessons to your advantage.",
"Think about old times and people with whom you've had strong connections, Gemini. Remember the good times you shared with people of common interests and similar hobbies. Be sentimental and mushy. Mend bridges and bring resolution to sticky issues. Be harmonious with the people and situations around you. World peace begins with you. Incorporate more of this ideal into your life.",
"Nothing will escape your attention today, Gemini. Your sixth sense is right on target. Your mind is razor sharp and emotions extra sensitive. You will move through this day with your radar fully intact. You're like a detective cutting through to the core of every issue. You will be able to get quite a bit accomplished with very little effort. Things will naturally flow your way.",
"People aren't going to want to be quite as intense as you require today, Gemini. Things are light and airy. You may find that no one is in the mood to delve as deeply as you want to go. Use the day to relax and release control for a while. Take deep breaths and long walks. Go for a bike ride or short road trip. Crazy, unexpected events may crop up throughout the day. Be prepared for surprises.",
"You may be anxious to say what's on your mind today, Gemini. Words are on the tip of your tongue and you aren't afraid to let them spill out. Be careful. There's a danger you will put your foot in your mouth. Your words may come across as harsher than you intended. Be sensitive of other people's emotions. Don't unload your problems on others.",
"Latch on to what your mind has to say today, Gemini. More than likely, your rational brain knows the right way to go. Your mood may dictate the action, but let your brain handle the steering. Don't get overly worked up over nothing. Tempers may rise in heated debates over what is and isn't fair. Be part of the solution, not the problem.",
"Your emotions are more peaceful and easier to control today, Gemini. It's almost as if you're merging with the energy around you. The one thing to be careful of is indecision. When it comes to taking action on something and you aren't sure which way to go, you'd do better to hold off. Make your big move some other day.",
"The stars will compel you to clarify your position within the collective, Gemini. You have a lot of power when you're part of a group, but you're sometimes clumsy about communication. You can't always succeed. The planets' positions will have a beneficial impact, and you will tend to put your life under the microscope.",
"You're a real charmer. None of your friends can resist you, Gemini. Today you should try to put the finishing touches to your personality. Indeed, you will be able to benefit from the planetary alignment as you interact with others. You will look for a little more authenticity in your personal and professional relations.",
"Haven't you wondered how it would feel to be omniscient, Gemini? Well, today you're about to have this experience. You will have the energy of ten. People will come to you and ask for your guidance. You will easily find the solutions to their problems. Today the world belongs to you.",
"Tension may build today from all directions, Gemini. Everyone may seem to be operating as part of a great conspiracy against you. Don't get paranoid. This scenario is most likely far from the truth of the matter. Try to embrace change and don't treat it like an enemy. Outdated ways of doing things may get in the way of important progress toward success.",
"Things should go well for you today as long as you can keep the drama to a minimum. You can jump over any hurdle in your way, so don't worry about a thing. You have a sharp, intuitive wit about you that's grounded in the real world. Take care of the details and plan your next big move. Clean, organize, and throw away things that no longer serve you.",
"A close loved one may express displeasure with the way things are, Gemini. Maybe there's some tension in the air. Things could get rather explosive. There's a feeling urging others to act, a certain restlessness that demands that you take action. Unfortunately, this action is likely to meet with opposition if you aren't careful.",
"Inflated egos might block your progress today, Gemini, so be on the lookout for people trying to get a bigger slice of the pie than they deserve. Be realistic in terms of how you allocate resources to people around you. Someone may be trying to take advantage of your generous spirit. Use your detective skills to get to the root of the problem and make any necessary changes.",
"It may seem like people aren't taking things as seriously as you'd like them to, Gemini. If so, take it as a hint that perhaps you're the one who needs to lighten up. Life is a game. In the grand scheme of things, we're merely specks of dust floating in space. Our lives are but the blink of an eye in relation to the universe. Don't take yourself so seriously.",
"If you tend to be a little anxious about solitude, Gemini, it doesn't necessarily mean you're dependent on the people close to you. That isn't the only contradictory thing about your behavior. You tend to want to bring people together while keeping your distance. From now on, you should try to be a little clearer in your relationships.",
"Some hidden problems in your house could suddenly appear, Gemini. This could involve plumbing, electricity, or the walls. Repairs are definitely indicated. It's best if you see to them right away rather than wait. The problem will only escalate if neglected. It's probably better to call in professionals than to try to do it yourself. Things like this are a drag, but they happen.",
"A close friend or romantic partner may seem in a rather quiet mood, Gemini, and disinclined to communicate with you. You might wonder if this person is angry with you or if you've said or done something that wasn't OK. It's likely that what's bothering your friend has more to do with work, family, or money than with you. Just make it clear that you're there if needed.",
"You could have heightened psychic awareness today, Gemini. You will probably notice it first when you pick up thoughts and feelings of family members, perhaps coming up with the same words at the same time. You may notice this phenomenon more throughout the day. You might experience visions or powerful premonitions. Make the most of this ability. It can increase your understanding of others.",
"Professional interests might temporarily interfere with your social life, Gemini. This might cause a little friction between you and a close friend or romantic partner. Your friend is more apt to want to brood than discuss it with you. Don't worry. This person will come out of the funk and be more understanding. Explain the situation the best you can and then continue with your work.",
"People close to you might be a bit worried about you, Gemini. Too much work and socializing might have you feeling less than your usual self, and perhaps even a little feverish and headachy. If so, this is a good day to take time out, stay home, and rest. Don't worry about sabotaging your success. It will continue. Take a break and your body will reward you with greater clarity and concentration.",
"Today you may put a lot of energy into your romantic relationship, Gemini. The astral energy is encouraging you to focus on romance. Give your significant other a special gift to show how much you care, and spend some time alone together. Any romance initiated or advanced today is likely to prove stable and long lasting. Don't let fear stand in your way. Move ahead.",
"You tend to enjoy solitude, Gemini, but today you might feel more reclusive than usual. Friends could invite you out, but you aren't likely to accept the offer. You might even feel a little irritated. This is a great day to work out or throw yourself into your own projects. Your concentration is good and the physical activity will get relieve the stress.",
"This is an excellent day to tell people exactly how you feel, Gemini. Your emotions are more stable than usual, so open up and speak from the heart. Listen. What you learn will be valuable for the future, so pay attention. Keep an eye on what is real, but let your heart explore all the possibilities. Follow your emotions and trust your instincts. You stand to gain a great deal.",
"Expect to minister to the needs of colleagues and family members today, Gemini. People may need to draw on your insight into human nature in order to understand themselves and others. Your common sense could prove invaluable. In the process of sharing your wisdom, you might also shed some light on emotional situations of your own. You could surprise yourself.",
"The day doesn't begin until you clear your head and take stock of some pending personal issues, Gemini. You might be making mountains out of molehills. Realize that there's a path for everybody. Put your stinger away today. It's powerful, but it won't do any good. Keep your power under wraps. Concentrate more on the mundane tasks that need to be done. Why not make a list?",
"Don't automatically think that beauty has to be defined by old-fashioned standards, Gemini. It's time to change the definition. There is no need to squeeze yourself into a socially constructed mold that doesn't resonate with who you truly are. Your job isn't to try and make sure everyone loves you. There's only one person you need to satisfy and that is you.",
"Tension may arise today, Gemini. It's possible that you're either too dreamy or too practical to deal effectively with the issue. It's important to strike a balance. The toughest part will be finding others who agree with you. The people you're in conflict with aren't likely to budge from their position. You may have to be flexible in order to reach a compromise.",
"Don't let things stagnate, Gemini. It's time to take action. See how far rather than deep you can go in everything you do today. Cover a wide range of topics and pick up a magazine or two. Take a break from your usual emotional intensity and enjoy the sunshine and the light conversation. Keep it all energetic and upbeat. Take action when you see that things are lagging.",
"Desire is the name of the game today, Gemini. If you want it, you can get it, but it won't come easily. The prize will go to the person who desires it the most. Show the people around you how much you can accomplish. You will impress others with your incredible drive and determination. Don't fall victim to the wasp that could sting you.",
"The intensity of the day may bring unexpected opposition, Gemini. Whether it's verbalized or not, the confrontations are quite real. Don't underestimate a loved one's emotions. Stand up to these issues and be realistic about their solutions. No one expects you to have all the answers, so don't pretend to. We're all human and we all make mistakes.",
"Things are slipping into place quite nicely for you, Gemini. Your persuasive manner and gentle nudges are enough to get people where you want them. Control is all yours if you want it. Remember that as you accept praise for success, you also need to be willing to accept the blame of failure. Any risks you take today will probably work out in your favor.",
"Why me? You may feel like you ask yourself this question more than anyone else, Gemini. Your life may seem like an intense roller-coaster ride that never stops. But deep down you realize that you would have it no other way. Take a break from it all today if you can. Communicate your thoughts and feelings. By talking, you will feel much better about the situation.",
"People may want to talk a great deal, but they're avoiding their feelings today, Gemini. Put your emotions on the back burner and let your mind take over. Deal with the facts and make sure your emotions don't interfere with the information you receive. Things can get clouded if you don't stay true to the communication that's taking place. Be conscious of the impact of your words.",
"There's a squeeze on your emotions today, Gemini, which might leave you feeling like a pot of boiling water. Just by knowing there's a lid on things, you're likely to heat up even faster than usual. Try to hold your temper. A rage will get you nowhere. Concentrate your energy on getting your material affairs in order. Deal with finances, investments, and long-term security.",
"Put your aggressions away today, Gemini. Laugh a little! Transform your energy from intense, hard, and caustic to lighthearted, fun, and loving. This will take you a long way. Little things may crop up that could disrupt your daily routine, but a warm smile is all you need to defuse any frustration or negativity.",
"You have a romantic soul, Gemini. Today your thoughts are on love and romance. You may be thinking of that special someone in your life, grateful that you've found each other. Or you may wish you had someone important in your life and spend a good part of the day plotting how to find a mate. If you're serious about settling down, draw on all of your resources to make it happen.",
"Flexibility is an important part of today, Gemini. Take a relaxed, laid-back approach. Trying to ram your ideas through isn't the best tactic. Having tunnel vision will restrict you in many ways. Keep an open mind and be receptive to others' ideas and opinions. You have a lot of power readily available. It would be a shame to waste it by lacking the breadth of vision to see all your options.",
"Try not to be so serious and intense today, Gemini. Walk with a lighter step and don't feel like you always need to be in control of every single thing you contact. Take on an attitude of going with the flow and you will be right in the place you need to be. Extreme actions will lead to extreme consequences. There's no need for that sort of behavior on a day like this.",
"You might be quite stirred by the general energy today, Gemini. \"Stirred\" may be too light a word. Put on your armor and get ready to do battle. Others may cower when they see what's going on outside, but you will want to jump into the fray. Strong emotions are the weapons of the day. Everyone knows that you have a strong arsenal in this department.",
"Romantic desire tempers spiritual passion today, and you may want to pursue both, Gemini. Perhaps your romantic partner is as spiritually inclined as you, and you aspire toward the same ends. Much of the passion you feel wells from deep within. So if you're creatively inclined in any way, you may want to memorialize these feelings through writing, painting, or music.",
"You may feel an urgent need to use your physical energy, which brings up the question of sports in your life, Gemini. Do you get enough exercise? If not, this could be a good time to join a gym. Even better would be participating in a group sports activity. Find one you like and get moving.",
"Don't get too emotional about a situation today, Gemini. You could feel a sinking feeling, but if you go that route you may end up in a pit of emotional quicksand that's hard to escape. Make sure you have a friend to talk to so you're prepared for whatever you might encounter on your emotional journey.",
"Today you may be inspired to have a little fun with your looks, Gemini. You may wish to change your haircut or experiment with different colors or styles of clothing. It would be fun to get out of your routine, even if it just means donning funky sunglasses or bright Hawaiian patterns. You will feel lighter and more flirtatious.",
"Situations and people with strong opinions about how things are done may impede your trajectory today, Gemini. Issues of love and romance may be the most affected by this tense energy. The key is to remember that everyone isn't your enemy. Try not to get paranoid about this. Do your best to take a relaxed approach and have confidence that things will work out fine.",
"Be more optimistic than usual today, Gemini. It's important that your intense emotions don't bog you down. You may lose sight of important facts. Maintain a healthy relationship between you and reality. You may find that your head is in the clouds and you're slowly slipping into some netherworld that has nothing to do with you. Don't get thrown off course.",
"Things that have been building for a long time suddenly come to a head today, Gemini. Strong, slow-moving trends rear their ugly heads. There's a great deal of opposition now making itself known in your life. Try not to lose yourself in the situation. See this as an opportunity to gain perspective and bring balance to the roller coaster that is your emotional life.",
"This is one day when you feel on the edge of either an emotional breakdown or a triumphant epiphany, Gemini. To ensure a positive outcome, don't take yourself too seriously. There's a degree of intensity to the day that's likely to make everyone feel they're wound up like a spring. One careless move could set off disaster. Do what you can to ease the tension rather than add to it.",
"Your emotions are likely to be pulled to extremes, Gemini. A key aspect of today is communication, and it wields a great deal of power. People are fighting for knowledge today so be sure of your facts before you start tossing them out there. You'll command respect from others, thanks to your solid commitment to the truth.",
"Your dander might be up today in reaction to someone's strong opinion. You don't want to back down, Gemini. The fire burns hot within you. Use this power wisely. Try not to use it in an aggressive, manner toward those you don't want to offend. Watch your back and keep your energy pure. You have the power to affect quite a number of people.",
"Remember that it takes energy to repress and bottle up your feelings, Gemini. Without realizing it you may be stuffing a great deal of emotion inside while trying to ignore it. The truth is that expressing these feelings - anger, happiness, fear, self-doubt - will energize and free you. The atmosphere around you will lighten up and you'll be able to interact more openly with others.",
"You pick up information quickly, Gemini. Someone only needs to explain something to you once for you to grasp the concept. Your questions are concise. No one can accuse you of not paying attention to his or her words or actions. At the same time, you may be too sensitive to the information around you. An overload of stimuli could eventually overwhelm you.",
"Ask for what you need, Gemini, and you will get it. Don't wait around for the rewards to come to you. This is one of those days in which actions speak louder than words. Don't expect others to read your mind. If you want something, go after it. There may be an element of the unexpected working its way into your day so be on guard.",
"Passions may run high, Gemini, and you could be right in the thick of things. Today may be a bit more intense than usual. Conflicting energies will butt up against each other in your head, and you might need to make an important decision now. You've done all the prep work you need to do. It's time to act.",
"Your ego is strong today, Gemini, and you have a strong will. This is a good time to put your plan for world domination into effect. Be sure you channel your powerful emotions into positive outlets. Create rather than destroy. Energy that isn't used in a positive way will end up manifesting as accidents or hostility toward people who don't deserve it.",
"You're probably looking for new objectives in your career and personal life, Gemini. Today you'll get the opportunity to share some dynamic ideas with new people. If you can, you should try to set up regular meetings with them. This could be your new group for brainstorming. These new friendships could be very productive in terms of personal fulfillment.",
"This is just the kind of day you like, Gemini - intense and supercharged, just like you! It seems there's a deadline coming up, or a time-sensitive project. You'll have a lot to do and not a lot of time in which to do it. This is when you're at your most productive. Just remember to drink plenty of water and eat. Even superheroes need fuel in order to accomplish their heroics.",
"If you get asked to lead a team in your personal or professional life, jump at the chance. Today you will get all the support you need, Gemini. Don't be afraid that you're not good enough. Things will come together without your having to do much at all. Besides, you already know that people are on your side!",
"Just when you thought you had everything figured out and planned correctly, another obstacle appears, Gemini. Your first reaction may be to get upset. Rage won't help. You can't always control everything. There are bound to be surprises. Plan for what you can, but know that there are often unknown forces working against your aims. Watch out!",
"Stay busy today, Gemini. Keep your mind occupied with basic tasks that need doing. You can accomplish a lot by multitasking, writing down a plan, and sticking to it. There is no shortage of things that need to be done so stop procrastinating. If you feel stuck on something, don't be afraid to ask for help. Friends and co-workers are your greatest resources right now.",
"You might have some important work to do at home, Gemini, but unexpected visitors might have other ideas for your day. Don't get angry or frustrated. Explain what's going on politely but firmly, and make arrangements to meet your friends later. They'll probably understand so there's no need to try to play host when your mind is somewhere else.",
"Recent overindulgence may have you to feel a bit under the weather this morning, Gemini. Avoid coffee and other stimulants. Try to sleep in if you can. Too much stress in your life certainly isn't helping. This malaise could pass by noon, but if you've been doing this a lot lately, you need to ask yourself why and find a way to quit doing it.",
"You may need to spend a lot of time in the car today, Gemini. You could hit traffic and miss some of the people you need to see. Irritations could quickly turn to anger if you aren't careful. Park your car and walk to some of the places. This will get you out of the crush of cars and work off your frustration at the same time.",
"A sudden feeling of love for your home could catapult you into redecorating, Gemini. News could come your way of sudden good fortune involving a family member. This is likely to affect the entire family in some way, so while you're happy for your relative, be glad for yourself, too. Don't be surprised if you feel a touch of envy. You're human, after all.",
"Money matters are likely to be advanced today through your intuition and inner power, Gemini. You may get a hunch that your idea for bringing in some extra money just might work. At least look into it. Don't let anyone talk you out of it until you know the facts. You might also rediscover a neglected talent that you could find quite useful at this time.",
"Have you invited some friends over for a celebration tonight, Gemini? If so, your guests are going to keep you hopping! That's all right. The day is filled with love and joy. Entertaining them is your way of expressing your appreciation. If you're romantically involved, you and your partner can celebrate privately after all your visitors are gone. Relax, let go, and enjoy your party!",
"If you've been thinking about investing, Gemini, this isn't the day to start. Not only would there be delays in processing your investment but it also probably won't pay off the way you hope. Read about the options open to you and then consult with someone knowledgeable in a few days. Think about it and then if you're so inclined, go ahead. Don't do it now!",
"Frustration may set in early today, Gemini, but things should pan out for you as the evening approaches. Once you deal with an issue, let it rest. There's no need to keep revisiting an old dispute just because you want to prove you're right. If people don't agree the first time around, they probably won't agree the second or third time either.",
"Some paperwork might need attention today, Gemini. You may also be on the phone a lot. Communication should be clear, open, and honest, so you'll accomplish exactly what you need to. An intimate and loving conversation could take place between you and a close friend or lover who might follow up with a visit to your home.",
"Don't assume that the person you're trying to reach is getting your messages, Gemini. Perhaps you've been waiting for a reply, thinking that this person has blown you off. Maybe this person doesn't understand the question you're trying to ask. When it comes to matters of love and romance, you're going to have to spell things out.",
"You may feel like you're being tested in some way, Gemini, like you're on trial and must defend yourself, including what you believe and how you operate. This feeling is unsettling, but soon you'll realize that it's strengthening in many ways. Questioning your behavior patterns is healthy, so open up in a way that you may not have considered before.",
"Jealousy might rear its head today, Gemini. The key to coping with it is to understand why you feel insecure. If you're jealous of a partner, why is this? Is trust an issue? If this comes up at work, is it because you don't feel recognized for your contributions? Examine the cause of jealousy. It's almost always a symptom of a deeper problem.",
"You have an intense nature. You probably feel things deeply and spend time lost in thought. Too much intensity can take a toll on your well-being. It might be time you got out and enjoyed yourself. Get up from your chair and take a walk. Meet someone for lunch or do a little shopping. Find something active to do to break the monotony of your routine.",
"Don't go overboard, Gemini. You may get so carried away in the early part of the day that by evening you notice you've gone beyond your own boundaries. Regret may sink in, and you may feel guilty about things you said or did. Prevent this by thinking things through before speaking or acting. You have the power to impact people on a deep emotional level. Use this power wisely.",
"Something out of the ordinary may appeal to you, Gemini, especially if life seems dull these days. Nothing says you can't indulge yourself as long as what you're considering isn't dangerous or something you'll regret. To bring some excitement into your life, just think through the means of attaining it. Perhaps all you need is to try a new sport or go out this evening.",
"Upsets among family members in the home could drive you to escape it all and throw yourself into your work, particularly creative projects of some kind. This might be the right course of action, Gemini. The situation isn't permanent, and perhaps the others in your household simply need to work things out for themselves. In the meantime, your work will give you satisfaction and perhaps even advancement.",
"Feed your mind today, Gemini. The day's energy supports growth and expansion, so why not see about learning about something you're interested in? Challenge yourself by reading or taking a class. There are plenty of online subjects to engage you. Find something that interests you that you can do in your own time.",
"Gemini, you may discover today that you have a talent for something you've never even thought about before. If you always stick to what you know, how will you ever experience anything new? Trying this unexplored area doesn't mean you have to excel in it. As long as you're completely absorbed and having fun, you'll enjoy a positive experience. Don't shy away from this. Go with it!",
"Some equipment at home that you usually take for granted might go haywire today, Gemini. More than one machine may not work as well as it usually does. This could prove frustrating, but don't get impatient and fix it yourself. Call a professional or things could get even more fouled up than they are.",
"There's action to be taken, Gemini, so make sure you get up early to make a fresh start. You may be on stage today in more ways than one. Your powerful words won't go unnoticed by others. You're dynamic and effective in the pursuit of your goals. Your mental acuity is in top working condition, and your words are emotionally charged.",
"Tempers could be short in a group with which you're affiliated, Gemini. What started as a meeting could end with disagreements. You might be tempted to chastise everyone, but that isn't a good idea. You won't stop the battle, and everyone involved will resent whatever you do. The best solution is to leave. The group probably won't accomplish anything positive anyway.",
"You could receive a phone call from a friend or relative you haven't seen in a long time, Gemini. This person might announce a pending visit, and very soon! You and your household might go crazy trying to make the place presentable. You'll probably enjoy the visit, but the announcement will cause some temporary chaos.",
"People may be tired of your harsh attitude, Gemini. This doesn't mean you should necessarily change your ways or who you are. Just be more aware of how your words affect others. Be prepared to take the heat when people defend themselves. Don't kick people around and expect them to never kick back. There's a frenzy of warlike energy in store for you today.",
"You may run into trouble if you penetrate too deeply today, Gemini. Keep things light and energetic if you can. Ironically, the harder you push to get something done, the more roadblocks you're apt to encounter. Things will flow easily if you're willing to let them. Give up some control and let a more whimsical energy lead the way.",
"Have you been doing a lot of walking lately? If so, Gemini, your feet may be sore. This could affect your energy level considerably, not to mention your ability to get any work done. Concentrate on routine tasks that require little thought and can be done sitting down. Stay out of any squabbles! Relax in a hot bath tonight.",
"You should feel optimistic today, Gemini, with confidence in your ability to accomplish anything you set your mind to. If you're working toward a specific goal (and you should be), something is likely to happen today that propels you that much closer to realizing your goal. What's the next step?",
"Don't spread the good news too quickly, Gemini. As exciting as it is, nothing is confirmed yet. Keep the information under your hat until plane reservations have been made or you have the job offer in writing. Whatever the good news is, it's exactly what the doctor prescribed to give your self-confidence a boost.",
"Career matters might be very stressful today, Gemini. Your generally penetrating mind is clouded by strong feelings about whatever you're doing and confused by differences of opinion among your colleagues. This could drive you crazy. Relax! The world won't come to an end if everything you need to do isn't done today. Sometimes it's easier to do something when it's OK if you don't do it!",
"Your level of concentration generally tends to be strong, Gemini, but today you could be temporarily at a disadvantage. Your thoughts seem vague and disjointed and you're less able to express yourself clearly and precisely. Make sure the people around you know that. At the same time put in extra effort to make yourself understood or you could cause confusion.",
"Troubles in the family may have you toying with the idea of moving or at least making some changes in your household. Someone close to you hasn't been honest with you, Gemini, and that also has you feeling a bit down. Kick around as many ideas as you can, but don't make any decisions today. It isn't the time. Wait until you're in a more positive and optimistic state of mind.",
"Hop on board early today, Gemini, or you may get left behind. If you sit around and wait for someone to grant you an invitation, you'll probably never get where you want to go. Once you get on, there'll be no stopping you. The key now is to take that first step. This is a good day to take the initiative and go wherever the tide takes you.",
"Today you might entertain a houseful of astrologers, with a few psychics and healers thrown in for good measure. Your head may spin as a result of all the concepts discussed, as if your brain can't process the information quickly enough. Don't despair. You're absorbing more than you think you are. After everyone leaves, take a walk or you won't be able to sleep.",
"Some misunderstandings could cause confusion in the home, Gemini. Your intuition and insight should defuse the situation, especially since you're more diplomatic than usual. You could also have an artistic inspiration, perhaps a new project that could be very important to you. It could be important to your career or it could open up new opportunities for you.",
"This is going to be a good time to get a global view of things, Gemini. Take full advantage of the current planetary aspects by reading some books on spirituality or travel. If you desire to go on a long voyage, don't be surprised if your job sends you on an adventure, even if it isn't part of your job routine. Don't hesitate! Go breathe in some fresh air in a new place!",
"You may feel extra passionate today, Gemini, so don't be surprised if you take things to extremes even more than usual. There's an aggression within you that's working to help keep you in control of every situation. Remember that you must be prepared to receive whatever you dish out. There's a warring instinct in everyone that's likely to emerge on a day like this.",
"Your thinking should be clear today, Gemini, and your sharp focus adept at revealing the truth of any situation. Your mind may be intertwined quite delicately with your heart, but the good news is that they're working harmoniously together. You're able to stand back and see the rational, logical side of your feelings as well as the emotional, tender side of your thoughts.",
"An old friend you may not have seen for a long time could come to visit today. This should be a surprise, but you'll probably be glad to see this person. You could purchase a new piece of equipment of some kind - a computer or home entertainment center. Your home should be busy, but you'll have fun.",
"You could be feeling energetic and driven. There's something you feel you absolutely must work on today. Chances are you won't be able to shake this conviction, so it's best if you just roll up your sleeves and get going on it. You'll undoubtedly get more accomplished than usual and be proud of the results.",
"Usually you trust your instincts about money, but today you should believe even more strongly in your financial sense. Unconventional ideas for increasing your income might come up. While your instincts might say go for it, your logic could tell you no. Help yourself by consulting professionals who know what's happening. If they agree with your instincts, go for it!",
"You're likely to have some intense experiences today. So what else is new? More people are receptive to your deep, investigative nature and they want to join you in your search. Collaborate with people at this layer of intensity and form strong bonds that will last long after the energy of the day is gone.",
"Social events, especially those unrelated to business, could bring exciting new contacts. Relationships with partners should be mutually beneficial, particularly when the people you're dealing with are friends. If you've been considering entering a new business partnership, this is the day to start discussing it seriously. Romantic partnerships begun or moved forward now should also go very well.",
"Have you been looking for some new ways to earn extra money? Today might find you studying all the latest statistics and economic trends to point you in the right direction. Research online could be beneficial, although you might not know where to look. You should still make some inroads that sound interesting.",
"Your mood should turn toward getting things underway. This may mean that you need to get certain things out of your way, including people. Don't be afraid to take action as necessary in order to get your point across. Deeds will speak louder than words. If you feel like time is passing you by, rip up the calendar and enjoy every moment as it comes.",
"People may be bearing down hard on you. They will have some facts to back themselves up. Your brain is like a computer storing bits of information to use at times like this. No one is safe against a mental and emotional arsenal like yours. If you've done your homework and prepared well, the challenges should prove to be no problem for you.",
"People will be focused on themselves, leaving you wondering what all the fuss is about. You have a strong desire to express your emotions. It may feel like you're on stage in some way. You wish to be recognized and appreciated for your sensitive, devoted, and passionate nature. Speak up.",
"Excitement mounts in your household when some new equipment comes into your possession. This could involve a computer, phone, or some other device. This could make a big different to everyone, but make sure you don't treat it like a toy. You'll want it to last a while!",
"Action should be your main priority, especially when it comes to love and romance. You may not be too concerned about what sort of action you take. Your only concern is that you aren't sitting still at any time. Once you figure out what you want, you're unlikely to stop until you get it. Your power is forceful and extreme.",
"A social event involving business associates and friends could bring fresh ideas your way, pointing you in a new direction. Your material and spiritual goals might come under discussion and open your eyes to previously unnoticed opportunities. Communication is clearer than usual. This may prove beneficial. Increased understanding brings you closer to others.",
"A major force confronts you now. It may seem like this energy will never stop. It might be mental or physical, but either way, you may be letting it consume too much of your attention. Try not to get caught in drama that doesn't really involve you. Remedy the things you can change and leave the rest. Take responsibility for your actions and let others worry about theirs.",
"Have you been waiting to execute some paperwork regarding money? If so, you might finally be able to do it today. Your signature on these documents may represent the first step to increased income as well as a whole new life, perhaps even something as subtle as a transformed state of mind. The change could be as monumental as a move to a distant place. Make the most of it.",
"Someone may approach you talking about investments. This person may make whatever he's pushing sound like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Remember the adage, \"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\" If you're interested in what this person has to say, wait a few days and then check with an unbiased source. It always pays to be cautious!",
"Someone once said that you can't be too rich, but today you may think this statement is false, at least when it comes to a friend. This person may have just come into some money and be discombobulated by it. He or she may ask your advice, but probably not follow it! Don't feel bad about it. It's out of your hands. At least you can manage your own funds.",
"Was there a task you wanted to have completed by now that was delayed for reasons beyond your control? Don't obsess over it. It isn't your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. Find something else to do so that thoughts of this chore don't creep in. Better yet, go out with a friend. If the Universe had meant for that task to be completed, it would have been!",
"Today's planetary aspects may have you experiencing a little cabin fever. If you have the urge to go off by yourself for a while, do so. Try a new diversion. Drive down a country road you've never explored. Find some antique shops. You probably need a break from your daily routine. You'll feel revitalized.",
"Expect to hear some great news today. Some distant relatives may call to say they're coming for a visit. Or you could find out about a trip that you and your family will take in the near future. Your spirits soar with the news, and you spread your excitement and positive spirit to others.",
"A very loving message could come to you from a woman, possibly your mother. If this is a letter, it may go on for several pages. If it's a phone call, the conversation could last for a long time. Try to schedule some free time during the day. Whoever this person is, this contact is going to make a very positive difference in your relationship.",
"Visits with friends and family are highlighted today. Regardless of whether they come to you or you go to them, you're bound to have a delightful evening. This is exactly what you need after the frustration of a long day, complete with delays and mechanical difficulties. Put it all behind you. Pass the pizza, refill the glasses, and enjoy some deserved downtime.",
"Try to be careful of missing the forest for the trees today. You may be concentrating on a detail in your personal or professional life that isn't as crucial to the big picture as you think. This kind of obsessive thinking is probably keeping you from progressing. Let it go. Sometimes it's necessary to sacrifice a battle in order to win the war.",
"Your mental acuity is high today. A recent innovation of yours could bring you some much-deserved recognition. Your mind is especially sharp at this point, and ideas come thick and fast. You have tremendous talent. If you focus it, you'll make some positive inroads toward building your success.",
"You're competing with someone today as you fight for dominance in a situation. The unspoken battle has begun, and the war won't end until you've successfully claimed your victorious position as ruler of the mountain. Defend your territory if you feel that someone is stepping on it. If you don't make it known that you're the boss, someone else surely will claim that spot.",
"You're swamped with paperwork regarding financial affairs. Bills need to be paid and checks deposited. There may also be a legal paper of some kind to deal with. Basically, everything looks great regarding money, so this is certainly welcome. Your circle of acquaintances may widen. Tonight you may receive an invitation to a social event that you choose not to attend.",
"Indulge in a day of laughter. Things get much more serious tomorrow, so use today to have some fun before it comes time to get down to business. If you don't join in with the happy-go-lucky attitude, you may get seriously depressed when you feel yourself slipping out of sync with everyone around you who's jolly and bright.",
"Money and creativity are successfully joined today. You might make money from a completed project, or you could receive some money to finance a project. Others might share in your efforts, but you're the mind behind the whole thing. Your intellectual powers are particularly strong. You're better than usual at expressing your ideas.",
"Family members may want to make changes in your home, such as remodeling, redecorating, or refurnishing, but there could be disagreements about the changes needed. Everyone will have a different idea. This isn't a good day to make such plans. It's unlikely that any agreement will be reached now. Put off the planning until another time.",
"An unexpected event might cause you to be temporarily separated from the special person in your life. Confusion surrounding the incident and your mate's role in it might plague you, and you might doubt your friend's motives. Money may be on your mind, and the need for it may have you brainstorming ways to increase your income. Don't make any decisions now.",
"Matters involving work and home should be going very well. Physically, you're feeling well and strong in spite of your recent overindulgence. News of success in things you've been working on for months should make your day. You might want to spend the rest of the day celebrating. The company of friends and family brings a lot of happiness, as does a romantic encounter.",
"Be careful about taking everything as a personal offense. Others' inconsiderate actions may hurt you emotionally, but they don't have to. As long as you're able to maintain a healthy perspective on the situation, you'll see that many of the behaviors that upset you result from someone else's insecurities as opposed to their lack of affection for you.",
"The next task on your road to success may be a pill that's hard to swallow. Perhaps it involves interacting with someone you don't want to deal with. You know that you have to adopt some sort of false persona in order to get what you want. You're sensitive to this dilemma, and you may feel emotional about it, making you hesitate to go through with the plan.",
"You mustn't expect any enormous changes today. The process you began three or four years ago will accelerate slightly. You're changing the moorings of your identity, the ideas that make you sure of who you are. Your family, background, and education no longer count for as much as your spiritual foundations.",
"Is a member of your household away? Your home could be a lonely place for a while. You miss your housemate, but you also enjoy the solitude and the quiet that enables you to catch up on your projects, which may include sleep! Dreams that come to you tonight could bring insights to solutions for business and finance. Write them down in the morning. You'll want to remember them.",
"Social events could put you into touch with intriguing new people who share your interests. This should be a gratifying experience. Your mind is quick and agile and your curiosity high, so you'll gain a lot from conversations. Perhaps you'll even make plans to attend lectures or workshops with your new acquaintances so you can learn more about what interests you all.",
"A close friend or romantic partner might not seem communicative today and you might wonder whether this person still cares for you. He or she is experiencing a few difficulties, perhaps involving money, and so isn't particularly good company. Listen if your friend wants to talk, but otherwise just be there. That's what is important anyway.",
"Love and romance blossom as a current or potential love partner comes on strong with passionate affection. This person could have a lot to say that catches you by surprise. In the past, communicating may not have been this person's strength, but now it's like there's no stopping the flow of words. Listen, and guard your responses. You'll need to think about what he or she says.",
"It will be a stimulating day for you. You'll feel great and have no trouble channeling all your energy into your activities. Don't be surprised if you encounter some resistance. Creative as your ideas are, they may not suit everyone. In fact, you may confront some rebelliousness. Be persuasive and you'll get your way.",
"Money matters may need attention today. Bills need to be paid, checks deposited, or contracts executed. The relief you get from handling this should lift your spirits considerably. Get out in the fresh air, take a walk, and work off some of your energy. Get the endorphins going. Phone a friend and spend the evening on the town. You've worked hard and you deserve it.",
"Try not to read too much into other people's words today. You may have spent hours tearing apart every off-the-cuff remark. You may build up a wild scenario in your head regarding what that person is thinking. Instead of trying to sneak up on the answer through the back door, try the direct approach. Simply ask your question.",
"Issues regarding romance could be a big part of the picture today. The scales could tip either way in terms of your success at this game. The decision is up to you. You're probably better off keeping things light and entertaining. Reveal the scope of your passionate and powerful emotions on another day.",
"The extreme passion that rules you may meet opposition today as more information appears. Communication may color the scene differently than you pictured in your head. Be patient and wait for all the spaces to fill in before you make any decisions about how to proceed. What is usually malleable and easy to affect may be a bit stubborn and rigid.",
"Today you might have the desire to look into your genealogy. The Internet has made it possible for everyone to learn about their ancestors, and now is a great time for you to do it. Spiritually, you might also decide to explore past lives or get in touch with spirit guides or totem animals. Group activities could be of great help in these pursuits.",
"You might host a group meeting or other social event. Your guests may be artistically or spiritually inclined. The evening should be a social success and an inspiring experience. Before they come, make sure everything's in place and working, from light bulbs to kitchen equipment. You don't want minor malfunctions to put a damper on the evening.",
"People may be relying on you in many ways today, so be careful that you don't let anyone down. You may feel like judges are evaluating your performance. Try not to get too carried away with this concept. What's most important is that you do your best, not necessarily that you achieve perfection.",
"Romance is at the top of your priority list today. A deep conversation may take place with your partner, perhaps to sort out your feelings about the relationship. Other matters of interest to you both could come up, and this bodes well for your future. Don't give in to the temptation to point out your partner's faults. Just say quietly what it is that you need.",
"Your competitive side may be a strong force in today's activities. Before you get too emotional about any situation, use logic and cold, hard facts to defend your position. Well thought out arguments presented clearly and concisely will be more effective than an emotional explosion full of tears and harsh words.",
"Your emotions might be raw today, and you may act rashly because of the way you feel. Realize that some people may not appreciate this behavior. Let your emotions be an asset that helps fuel your passion, but don't let them rule you entirely. Temper your actions with self-restraint and you'll get through the day.",
"You may feel like someone is giving you an emotional slap. Don't immediately react by putting up your defenses. You'll do much better if you step back and analyze the situation before concluding what's right or wrong. Your feelings are precious, and you shouldn't let others bully you. At the same time, you have no right to bully others.",
"Valuable tips to increase your income could come your way today, possibly from a close friend or colleague. You should feel well and look particularly attractive.

"An unexpected sum of money could cause chaos in your home, but it's an exciting, pleasant sort of pandemonium!

You might want to host a celebration!",
"Love and romance are going marvelously well today. If you're attached, affection continues to grow between you and your partner. A strong sense of unity could lead to a firm commitment. If you aren't currently involved, don't be surprised if someone you like but don't know well suddenly seems attracted to you.",
"Newspapers may bring knowledge of strange events that capture your imagination. You might want to learn more about the stories and similar events. Your mind is sharp enough to grasp it all, yet there will still be hidden elements that render it that much more fascinating. The human mind and its dark side might be especially interesting to you today.",
"Love and romance are in your favor even though roadblocks may keep you from taking full advantage of the situation. You're being much too picky about the type of person you seek. Love isn't meant to be a set of desired qualities on a shopping list. You can't realistically create a scenario of how things will work out. Let things proceed naturally.",
"New learning and improved communication with friends and family add greatly to your sense of self-esteem. A task into which you've put some effort over the past several weeks has been completed successfully. You're now basking in the glow of others' admiration. You may even have a few extra dollars to spend. You've worked hard for this and deserve it.",
"A joint endeavor with a partner could lead to imaginative and creative opportunities. You feel energized and ready to take on just about anything. Whatever you start today, especially creative projects, should succeed in spite of any obstacles that come up. Relations with partners and others should be recharged by the day's activities.",

The planetary configuration can help you do that now. People will be much more receptive to your natural charms if you can change your controlling attitude!",
"Today someone might ask what you're thinking about. You often think about things that are inaccessible to others. Today it will be like you've gone inside yourself on your quest for answers to spiritual questions or the secrets of life. Just tell him or her you're trying to rest, as they probably won't understand what you're thinking about anyway.",
"Some good news on the financial front could open a world of possibilities today. Perhaps you'll decide to spend some money sprucing up your home. Or maybe this is the financial cushion you need to start your business. You're energetic and enthusiastic about your new ventures, but make sure to pace yourself for the long haul.",
"Emotions might run high with today's astral energies. Your friends may be snapping at each other and even getting into quarrels. Stay out of it! It's best to concentrate on getting the problem taken care of and take away the reason for the tension rather than try to control it. Hang in there.",
"You've allowed money issues to become too prominent. It's true that your financial picture isn't as rosy as you'd like it to be, but whose is? Try to put your troubles in perspective. There's no need to let these worries impact your relationships with friends and family. Ask for help if you feel you need it.",
"Something may be distracting a close friend or love partner so much that this person isn't very good company. Nor will your friend want to share the source of their preoccupation. Don't try to have a long conversation about it. Back off and let your friend come to terms with it alone. Sometimes that's all you can do.",
"You deserve a day off. Why not play hooky from your duties and surround yourself with beautiful works of art? Better yet, try to create some yourself.

It will help relieve some of the pressure you've been feeling inside. Be careful not to relax completely. If you do, you may not be able to get out of bed!",
"Be careful about blaming yourself for something that you aren't responsible for. Maybe you influenced someone to act a certain way and now that action is backfiring negatively.

Take control and push beyond your boundaries. You'll find validation. This is one of your fantastic \"up\" times when you're glowing with passionate radiance that showers light on the rest of the world.",
"News of illness or employment problems on the part of someone you care about can have you feeling a bit down in the dumps today. A warm, loving letter or call from someone far away might cheer you. This is a good day to write newsy letters or visit or call people you haven't heard from in a long time. Don't let sad news or a bad mood get the better of you.",
"A group encounter, perhaps spiritual or metaphysical, could take place at your home tonight. This group will probably manage to do whatever it aspires to do.

Tonight write down your thoughts and insights so you can remember them.",
"A partnership that may have been moving steadily forward might seem stalled in its tracks. This could involve either business or romance. This isn't a good time to try to pressure your partner toward progress. You'll only meet stubborn resistance, which will slow things down even more. Be patient and let things progress in their own time.",
"It may be difficult to focus. The trick is to not take anything too emotionally. Keep things on the light side, and don't get too frustrated if you can't seem to find the tools to dig as deeply as you'd like. You may be more productive if you skim many issues instead of trying to penetrate deeply into one in particular.",
"Today the cosmic conditions are great for peak physical and mental energy. You'll be able to take on almost anything.
