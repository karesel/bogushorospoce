exports.arr = ["Although you may want to bring things down a bit so you can better plan, organize, and rearrange, Leo, this may not be the best course of action today. You're better off keeping things light and uplifting. Things will fall into place as you need them. Trust in others. Realize that some of the best experiences you will have in life are spontaneous. Put your to-do list away.",
"You will recognize and appreciate the need for structure and stability on a day like today, Leo. This practical energy may work to take away some of the fun out of the equation. You may not realize it, but the fun in your life may be getting chipped away little by little. Hold tight to the things that give you passion and purpose in life. These are the keys to healthy living.",
"Stay grounded and focused today, Leo, You can accomplish a lot if you set your mind to it. You may sense a blurry cloud lingering - this is your emotion talking. Amid all the goal-oriented pursuits, mental processes, and work-related issues, you have given short shrift to your feelings. It's OK to cry. Recognize that emotions are an important part of you. They deserve your attention.",
"Today is a great day to get rid of the stuff that's cluttering up your life, Leo. Get to the heart of the issue and stop beating around the bush. Your emotions may feel a bit more negative than usual, but realize that you can use this to your advantage. Your sober attitude can aid in making extremely practical, well-grounded decisions.",
"Take a cold shower to jump-start yourself today, Leo. It's fine if you laze around a bit in the morning, but by evening, you should be working at full capacity. You will be called into action whether you want to be or not. Notice how active your dreams are tonight and over the next couple of nights. Messages are trying to get through, so listen.",
"Messages from close friends expressing their love and admiration for you may seem to arrive out of the blue. Your accomplishments over the past few weeks may have caused them to see you in a new light. Today you will experience the full force of their feelings. The doors of communication are open for you. You could decide to spend the day getting to know your friends all over again.",
"There may be serious challenges in your daily routine today, Leo. How can you organize your day more efficiently? Take time to set a plan into motion. Write it down. You may want to drift into another realm, so let those emotions roam free - just make sure you deal with your daily tasks first. This will give you more freedom to take advantage of the blast of creative power that you have now.",
"As you continue to enjoy success and good fortune, your self-confidence grows, Leo, and so you're likely to attract new relationships with fascinating people in exciting fields who share your vision and interests. These could be business associations, close friendships, or new romantic partners. Relax and be yourself. You don't have to impress anyone. They probably already like you.",
"A trip through exclusive boutiques or antique shops might have you throwing financial caution to the wind and buying luxury items you hadn't planned for. This is all right - up to a point. Take care not to buy more than you can use. Don't go to the opposite extreme and be too miserly either. You've worked hard and deserve a treat or two.",
"Today you could doubt the amount of money you might get from a business transaction. If you can, verify this before starting anything. You aren't being told something. Personal relationships, particularly love and romance, should be stable and rewarding now, although today you may not have much time to spend with those you care about. Hang in there.",
"You might feel overworked today. Your energy could be flagging, and you may even feel feverish. This is probably nothing more than stress, Leo. Most likely you should take time out from your busy life and relax. Spend the afternoon at the movies. Treat yourself to dinner out. Buy yourself a present. Tomorrow you should feel better again.",
"News might bring exciting opportunities for increasing your income, Leo. Perhaps you will learn of ways to start your own business. Maybe the demand for people with your skills has increased. You might discover the efficiency some new technology for managing your finances. Discussions with others should bring many new ideas your way. Make the most of them.",
"Today you may want to set aside some time to spend with close friends or a love partner, Leo. Other responsibilities could have you on your own, taking care of errands and other important matters. You may have the feeling of being lonely in a crowd. Don't waste time feeling sorry for yourself. Take care of business and get back to your loved ones.",
"Today you're likely to feel especially communicative, Leo. You might want to get on the phone and run ideas for new projects by colleagues or perhaps make arrangements to complete current projects. Success through creativity is strongly indicated at this time. This is a great day to seek success through writing or speaking. If this has been on your mind, get started.",
"Today you might try to put computers or other forms of advanced technology to work for you, Leo. This could be of great benefit to you. You might be blown away by the advantages of it. Your mind should be quick enough to grasp any new software or equipment that you will want to use. The innovation could also help raise your earning power. Isn't technology wonderful?",
"New, exciting opportunities to earn more money might come your way today, Leo perhaps through new fields. Colleagues could bring information. Your sense of adventure is high, so risks might seem more attractive than usual. Don't get carried away. Don't forget to explore every possibility in detail before committing to anything. Nothing is certain, even on days like today.",
"Some projects might require practical attention today, getting irritating little details cleared up and out of the way. Your natural efficiency is at a peak, Leo, so you will probably be able to get these matters done before you get too bored. The important thing is that you will be able to achieve the results you want. Go to it.",
"Some very intense dreams could take you back to the past, perhaps your childhood or past lives. Write down any dreams you remember, Leo. They might not make sense to you now, but if you go back and analyze them later, you're likely to find that they reveal a lot about you that you weren't previously aware of. They might even inspire new projects of some kind. Think about them carefully.",
"Take a break from the routine and get off the beaten path, Leo. This is a day to forge ahead with ideas and dreams rather than commitments and answers. Question things and debate the facts. Have fun whatever you do. This is the perfect day to go out and fly kites with your friends. All group activities are strongly favored. You can't go wrong chatting about the latest events in your life.",
"Today you might wonder what's bothering a friend, Leo. This person may seem depressed and worried but not inclined to share the worries with you. All signs are that these are probably money problems, which he or she wants to keep private. Let your friend know you're there if needed, then concentrate on your own concerns. Your friend will share when the time is right.",
"If you own property, you might discover that its value has increased far beyond anything you dreamed of, Leo. This might involve real estate, but it could also involve other resources like stocks, bonds, or family heirlooms. What you choose to do with this information is up to you, but you will probably decide to hang on to what you have. It's just nice to know it's valuable.",
"Even though you think of yourself as a rational person, Leo, today your intuition is so keen that even you can't ignore it. Rather than try to will it away, why not embrace the messages that bombard you? Give yourself this one single day to embrace the possibility that you may have some extrasensory ability. There's no harm in trying to understand the extent of your power.",
"The planetary configuration makes you likely to reap the benefits of all your hard work, Leo. The little windfall you receive is nice, to be sure, but don't think of all of it as fun money. Put a good amount aside in a savings or investment account. You can use the rest to kick up your heels a bit. Why not invite a friend to dinner at the nicest restaurant in town?",
"Do you have a desire to go away on a trip? Would you like to live in Europe or Asia? These are desires that you may well have at the moment as you begin the process of widening your field of vision. See if you can set up a journey of this kind, Leo. People will have confidence in you now, so all sorts of possibilities are at your disposal.",
"Today, Leo, you might feel a little insecure about your state of physical fitness. You could decide to make up for any lack of exercise over the past few weeks. This is fine, but take it slowly. This isn't the day to push yourself. Strained muscles and exhaustion could result, and that won't do you any good. Work out, but pace yourself.",
"A financial windfall could come as the result of a coup that no one expected you to pull off, Leo. Everyone is likely to be very proud of you - and you will be very pleased with yourself, too. This is only the start of a fortunate new turn in your life. As far as money goes, it may all be smooth sailing from here on out.",
"Attempts to attend a festival, party, or other group activity could be hampered by minor obstacles like traffic jams, forgetting things, and getting lost, Leo. This can be frustrating and irritating, but don't let it stop you. It's important to be out with your friends today. Fill up the car, get a good map, and make your way to the place by the side streets. Have some fun!",
"Today you might decide to sign up for an advanced course of some kind, Leo. This might include world religions or perhaps meditation. Stay out of bookstores, both physical and online. You might spend a fortune on books on your chosen subject. The effect of this is likely to be more profound than a simple accumulation of knowledge. Prepare to be transformed.",
"This is likely a day when you want to reflect on your successes. As your professional success continues to skyrocket, your sense of self-confidence follows suit. So do your relationships with family, friends, children, and romantic partners. Your mind is especially sharp, Leo, and your personal innovations should continue to progress. Life is good and likely to stay that way for a while.",
"Your subconscious mind is active today, Leo, perhaps releasing old traumas from the past. Memories from long ago could pour into your mind as though floodgates were opened. Many of them won't be pleasant. This is good nonetheless. You're releasing obstacles caused by these memories. By the end of the day you will feel so much lighter. Make the most of it.",
"Have you been exercising beyond your fitness level, Leo? If you have, you're probably feeling very tired, sore, and out of sorts. Take it easy today, even if you don't want to. You can still exercise, but concentrate on yoga and tai chi rather than more strenuous programs like aerobics. Push yourself a little, but not too much. The idea of \"no pain, no gain\" is a fallacy.",
"Some information that you've been seeking for a long time might finally be unEarthed today through your diligent efforts, Leo. This is going to increase your ability to take on whatever challenges you're planning to address. Your already sharp business acumen is likely to be enhanced by whatever you discover. Be prepared for a lot of hard work and continued success over the next few months.",
"If you're into writing, Leo, this is the perfect day to sit down and churn out the words, even if it's only a letter to a friend. Your imagination is especially vivid, your expression clear and understandable, and your vocabulary skills especially acute. If this is a thesis or article, you may spend hours on it. Don't worry. It will be that much better for it.",
"A delivery could come to your house that you find very emotionally moving, Leo. Perhaps you've received a gift that represents a big sacrifice to the giver, and was all the more sincere for that. This could be on your mind for most of the day even though you have a lot to do. When thanking the giver, be warm and sincere but not too effusive. You don't want to embarrass your friend.",
"Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Leo, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.",
"For you, Leo, relationships with other people should be going so well that you feel more loved than ever. A new friend or perhaps an old one you haven't seen in a while could suddenly become a powerful part of your life. You're probably feeling exceptionally innovative and more likely to make a success of whatever new ideas you have. Prepare for a busy and satisfying day.",
"The coming days promise a busy social time, Leo. You might host a party at your home. You may feel terribly rushed and wonder if you will be able to get everything done. Don't worry. It will all come out all right. Friends or family members could prove invaluable in lending assistance. At some point, you might attend or take part in a sports event.",
"If you can't feed your artistic tendencies in the work you do, today is a good day to create a better balance and make your days more satisfying. Art isn't just for artists, Leo. All you have to do is take the initiative to create something and you will see just how good it feels. Have you ever thought about writing a children's book? This is one idea, considering the planetary aspects.",
"You're a hard worker, Leo, and you expect the same from the people around you. Today you may want to take a look at your personal and work relationships. Demanding person that you are, you may be concerned about the quality of your friendships. Don't be afraid to separate good from bad. Life is too short to devote your energy to bad relationships.",
"When you least expect it, success comes into your life. You can say goodbye to the dreariness of daily routine, fears, and changing moods. You're now entering a period of wonderful good luck and success. All this comes despite the fact that sometimes you might lack confidence in yourself. That doesn't matter anymore, because success is on your side from now on.",
"Today you could attend more than one social event, Leo. Some of your professional colleagues will probably be there. Conversations are going to focus primarily on business development and the economy in general. A lot of useful information could result from social contacts with others in your field. Write it all down. You will want to remember it so you can make use of it later.",
"Some vivid and interesting dreams could bring a lot of repressed memories up and force you to confront them. This could be a bit disconcerting, Leo, but still positive. Psychological obstacles to financial success and romantic happiness could be cleared away, which could change your life. It's vital that you write down your dreams. You won't want to miss out on this.",
"Today you may be asked to choose between the old and the new, Leo. It's as if people are protesting in some manner and you're being asked to join in the ranks of those wishing to see change. Make sure you honestly assess all the available information before you automatically dismiss the situation as foolish. You should seriously consider lending a hand to the fight.",
"You may be plagued with restlessness, Leo, to the point that you may not be able to get anything done. If you sense that this is happening to you even in the slightest degree, stop whatever you're doing and take a break. Your work isn't worth the sacrifice of your sanity. Consider going to a spa or call up a friend with a hot tub so you can soak in some warm, relaxing water for a while.",
"A friend who's having money problems might dump all their woes on you today, Leo. Your inclination isn't to be very sympathetic, but hold back that tendency. The situation is real, and your friend is very worried and needs solutions more than criticism or sympathy. Your common sense and practical nature could be invaluable right now. Offer to listen.",
"Your heart beats extra strong today, Leo, but it may not seem like anyone knows it but you. You may feel like you aren't really fitting in with the energy of the day. Don't get down on yourself for it. Realize that not everything is going to go according to your plans. Let things come to you. The unexpected is bound to happen, so don't try to resist the impending change.",
"Memories from your distant past could resurface today, Leo. You may wonder why you're suddenly thinking about them, but they probably represent a release of old emotional hang-ups that have been holding you back. By midafternoon you should feel more focused, determined, and ready to take on anything. This is definitely a great day to start a new project or complete an old one.",
"A friend could be depressed and need your advice, Leo. Some long-held, cherished goals that you've been working toward could be temporarily blocked, causing you to wonder if they will ever come to fruition. Don't waste any time lapsing into negative thoughts. Assess what needs doing and do it. This is only a temporary situation. You will get through it, but it's up to you how quickly.",
"Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues we don't wish to share, Leo, but this affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who this person is. Try to get him or her to open up without exerting pressure. Unfinished tasks could be driving you crazy. You may try to run through them quickly, causing too much stress. Get the most crucial done and let the others go.",
"Emotional talks with your partner could move you to tears, Leo. If there have been difficulties in your relationship, you've overcome them and probably reached a new understanding. Any romantic relationship or friendship started or moved forward now shows lasting promise. Your inclination may be to control your feelings, but don't be afraid to show them. It's OK in situations like this.",
"Today is a fantastic day for you, Leo. Things are naturally flowing your way. You can accomplish a great deal. There are few hurdles in your way, perhaps none. You're well disciplined about your time and what's needed to get the job done and how to meet your goals. Your emotions are especially calm and stable, giving you the opportunity to observe and evaluate them from a neutral viewpoint.",
"A love letter or perhaps a poem or other artistic work dedicated to you could make your day, Leo. A warm feeling of being cherished and adored could stay with you throughout the day as a result. Hang on to this rosy glow when things get rocky, especially on the job. The feelings expressed in this communication will probably last for a long time, so be prepared.",
"Are you working two jobs, Leo? Today one could demand a lot of you, probably at the expense of the other. You tend to be very conscientious and responsible, so this might bother you, but don't let it get to you. The day may come when the situation is reversed. Everyone around you knows that you're an asset to the enterprise, even if there are times like this when you have to ask for a break.",
"Getting along with others may prove challenging today, Leo. The influence from the planetary aspects can have you preferring to withdraw and isolate. You might feel impatient and annoyed. If so, and being alone is an option, go for it. If it isn't, you will need to curb the tendency to be argumentative or confrontational. Exercise patience and avoid conflict.",
"If you think you have to prove that you have something valuable to offer, Leo, consider this carefully. You're naturally friendly and can get along with almost anyone. This may already be your strength. You have something great to bring to a crowd. Consider being yourself and not trying so hard to feel a part of things. Look at your qualities and you will prove your worth to yourself.",
"Focus on yourself today, Leo. Take note of your health. You probably know that this is something you must take care of always, not just sometimes. Daily routines are important. It's up to you to stick to them. The little things like taking vitamins, staying active, and relaxing help maintain a healthy body. If you aren't feeling your best, make your habits more conducive to glowing health.",
"You may find that today brings great physical strength and energy to you, Leo. Given this, you may really want to do some tough, challenging physical work. This is certainly the day for it, so why not go for it? Do some yard work or clean out closets, cupboards, drawers, and filing cabinets. Consider donating items that you don't use anymore or plan a garage sale to make some bucks.",
"Feed your mind new knowledge, Leo. Visit a bookstore or read some interesting information on the web. If you have more time, visit the library or find out about some courses that might be perfect for you. There's knowledge to be had everywhere you look, provided you're open to receiving it. People are often the best resource. Ask someone to explain something, if that's what you need.",
"Today's energy will help you take steps toward getting things in order, Leo. Tackle the drawers, closets, storage rooms, and cabinets. Organization is a good activity for today. Creating order brings a sense of peace and personal control. Mental organization like goal setting, budgeting, or scheduling will add to this feeling. Sift through and clean out as many corners as you can.",
"The planetary alignment is favorable, and you're in the process of reaping the benefits, Leo. It was only a matter of becoming aware of and settling certain matters related to your need for social recognition. Don't be so hungry for approval, Leo. Everybody contains a stern inner parent and can survive comfortably in total self-sufficiency. In fact, it's your greatest strength.",
"Family members could spring some surprising news on you today, Leo. This news may concern people you know or perhaps a family member has some interesting plans of his or her own that you weren't aware of. Although positive, this news could throw you for a loop. It should definitely cause you to alter your thinking in some way. Don't let emotion overwhelm logic right now.",
"You may need to make some mental adjustments in order to get on the same wavelength as other people today, Leo. You may not see what all the fuss is about. Don't take things too seriously and don't feel like you need to make sense of every detail that presents itself. Some things are best left unknown. Enjoy the diversity in your world and respect the differences in other people's approaches.",
"Things should be going well for you in the love and romance department, Leo, but you could find that today things get a bit tenuous. While you want things to be clear and planned out, it could be that your partner longs for more freedom and spontaneity. Tension may result if either party becomes too set in their ways. The tension may arise when neither partner wants to take the lead.",
"Mundane and perhaps boring tasks could take up much of your morning, Leo, but you will need to get them out of the way so you can move on to more exciting projects. More paperwork might be required in order to get these things started, but you will get it done quickly and efficiently. Keep on plugging along. You're on the right track!",
"Spiritual insights you received over the past few days could turn your thoughts to serving others. You might have a talent for teaching and choose to share what you've learned in this way, Leo. You should feel especially healthy and energetic, so you may be tempted to plunge ahead. Plan carefully. Even the most admirable of enterprises needs to be faced in a practical frame of mind.",
"You're practical and down to Earth, Leo. Today your intuition is more active than usual. You might receive some powerful messages from the higher planes that open up new doors for you. Don't ignore them. Think about what's in them before you accept or reject them. You could also tune in more strongly than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others.",
"Your mind is sharp today, and your willingness to work is equally strong, Leo. Use this powerful combination of forces to your full advantage. You will find that your brain is like a powerful steel trap. There is very little that will escape your attention. The most important thing for you to remember is to not let other people obstruct your progress.",
"Take your mind off your stressful duties and responsibilities today, Leo. This is a time for emotions and ego to connect in harmony. Don't let other people's problems ruin your good mood. There's a need for you to consciously let your mind and body be at ease. Art and music will bring you a great deal of pleasure. Indulge in the things that make you truly happy.",
"A friend could be having financial troubles and ask you for a loan, Leo. You like this person and understand what he or she's going through, so you want to help. But it could be a while before your friend is solvent again. If you make the loan, remember the adage about never lending anything to a friend that you aren't willing to consider a gift. Don't depend on immediate repayment.",
"An increased awareness of subtle undercurrents may have you feeling a bit disconcerted today, Leo. You could experience clairvoyant or telepathic abilities you didn't know you had. As you usually like to be down to Earth and realistic, this may throw you for a loop, but try to flow with it. Reality isn't necessarily limited to what is perceived by the usual five senses!",
"You may feel rather introspective today, Leo, and decidedly out of step with everyone else's frenzied pace. You're a thoughtful person with deep spiritual beliefs. It's understandable that you may sometimes feel disheartened by all the consumerism and conspicuous consumption that fills society. Try not to let this get you down. Try to focus instead on your reasons for being happy.",
"If you've been concerned about your health for any reason, Leo, today your medical professional could give you a clean bill of health. You will believe it, because you're likely to feel wonderful. Stress has vanished, at least for now, and your energy and enthusiasm are higher than they've been for a long time. Enjoy yourself. Go out with some friends. You've earned it!",
"Your imagination is flying high today, Leo. Whatever challenges come up, you will find ingenious solutions to them. Love matters and the creative arts could come to the forefront. This is definitely a good day to indulge your interests, whatever they are. You've worked hard and deserve some time to simply sit back and enjoy yourself. Have a great day!",
"It's unlike you, but today you rely on your intuition to guide you through some tricky territory, Leo. You may be somewhat distressed by the behavior of the people close to you. You're at a loss to understand their thinking. You will find that when you stop thinking logically and let yourself feel emotionally, you will likely gain insight into their actions.",
"Some intense work you've done in the past that you might have forgotten about could have caught the attention of someone in authority, Leo. Some long-overdue rewards for that work might come your way today. This should definitely prove a very pleasant and welcome surprise. It could have your mind reeling for a while. Come back down to Earth and then go out and celebrate!",
"Intuition could prove extremely valuable when it comes to dealing with a sticky situation, Leo. You know all the rules, you know all the proper methods for whatever you do, but today you could be driven to make decisions based on gut feelings rather than rules or logic. Think of it as a valuable new tool for understanding how to deal with people and make the most of it.",
"A friend could put forth some ideas regarding incorporating the arts into a business enterprise, Leo. A lot of discussion could result, though it's unlikely that any final decisions will be made now. More ideas should come over the next few days. Some intense research on your end should shed some light on the workability of the project. Go to it!",
"Your career is about to take a turn for the better, Leo. New professional possibilities may come your way today. Be receptive to any invitations or offers. Your advancement may not come in the most traditional way, so you need to pay close attention. Don't overlook something that seems beyond your capabilities. Your reach should always exceed your grasp. Stretch!",
"You won't feel particularly social today, Leo. You'd be happiest at home with a good book, a good meal, and no contact with the outside world. Alas, such solitude isn't always possible. You may have to balance your need for isolation with obligations to colleagues. Part of your grumpiness might be due to a physical imbalance. Make it an early night and you will wake tomorrow with a new attitude.",
"Unsettling developments regarding money could cause some upset, Leo, but they'll be resolved by day's end. You could lose and find your wallet or bank errors could prove to be its fault and not yours. Someone you thought you knew well could show a darker side you haven't seen before and cause you to reevaluate your involvement with that person. This is a great day to resolve inner issues.",
"Positive emotions like love, enthusiasm, or optimism that have been repressed for years could surface today, bringing a new sense of joy and anticipation for the future, Leo. This could involve activities that you enjoyed as a child. Don't feel silly if you want to ride a merry-go-round or go to the circus. You should indulge your inner child from time to time. Have fun.",
"Pour yourself a comforting cup of tea today, Leo. Take a hot shower or a long bath. In short, pamper yourself. You may be picking up on the extra tension of the people around you. Be conscious of this and make a mental note to strip away the garbage that others dump on you. You're a sensitive individual. Pat yourself on the back and look out for sudden moves from others.",
"If someone tries to criticize you, Leo, don't be afraid to defend yourself. Other people aren't going to be afraid to speak their minds, and you shouldn't either. You may feel like someone is prodding you with a stick. They probably just want to get some sort of reaction out of you. Be honest about how you feel and explain your statements instead of just being curt.",
"New earning or investment possibilities could have you in a quandary over which one is the best for you, Leo. There are a number of solutions - technology may be one of them - but this isn't the time to make any important decisions. Everything may seem equally attractive to you! Professional advice might help, but even so, don't feel you have to make a decision right away. Wait a few days.",
"You might spend a lot of time in conversation with friends who share your interests. Their insights could lead to new insights on your part, Leo, and vice versa. This process could bring all of you closer together. Good news could come through the mail, email, or phone regarding goals you've been trying to reach. You're also likely to send out a lot of communications yourself.",
"Nurture your artistic, romantic side today, Leo. Your feet may be a little cold, but that's what you get for splashing around in the rain. Don't worry about it. Your heart and mind are finally on the same page and it's much easier to say exactly how you feel. Take off the wet socks and put on a dry pair. Take to the streets and meet up with a fun troupe of merriment tonight.",
"Matters of the heart may not be going smoothly, Leo. Perhaps someone's approach has been too aggressive. Maybe you've been too pushy about what you want. Tension builds up and creates disharmony instead of love. Perhaps you need to examine the dynamics of the relationship. Tough times may indicate that the honeymoon is over. If you're single, it's probably for the best right now.",
"Take some time to break out of your normal routine and see what's going on in the world around you, Leo. You could be so focused and so driven toward a specific goal that you fail to take into account the rest of the world. You may not even be aware that these outside energies have a huge effect on what you're doing in your own little compartment.",
"Money that you may have been hoping to use to better your living or working condition could suddenly come your way today, Leo. Ideas for how to put it to work in the most efficient, satisfying way could pop into your mind quickly. You will probably want to write them all down, consider your options carefully, and then choose the ones that suit your needs best. Go to it.",
"Check your messages often, Leo. Someone is trying to contact you and you may keep missing each other by minutes. It's important to connect with this person to take care of some matters. If your objectives are clear, things should work out fine. Two people working toward the same goal make the power of the joint effort extremely potent. Don't underestimate this incredible influence.",
"You may keep having the same thoughts over and over in your head, Leo. Each day you may work out a different scenario for the way it comes to an end. You know that you will get to this critical decision at some point in your life, so why not experiment with all the solutions now? Stay calm and turn to others when you get into a bind along the way.",
"You're a hard worker, Leo, with a good business head and strong practical sense. However, success in the past few weeks might have you thinking about doing something more innovative to earn your money, possibly something to do with the opportunities surrounding the Internet. Business and personal communication of all kinds should come to you during this auspicious period.",
"Relax and settle down today, Leo. Take some time to enjoy where you are and the people around you. There's a promise that you need to fulfill, and you should think about how you can honor it now. Do something for others instead of keeping the focus on you and your goals and ambitions. The more you invest in others now, the bigger the payoff you will receive from these actions in the future.",
"You may be trying to deal with things in a neat, orderly manner today, Leo. Try not to get too frustrated if things don't work out exactly the way you'd like. Tension may occur when matters of the heart come up for discussion. People may get rather emotional, sending your neat, orderly plan right out the window.",
"You could meet new friends at a social gathering, Leo, people who could become valuable business contacts. You might learn of new and different investment opportunities that reflect the changing times, and these could capture your imagination. Your understanding of others runs deep, so relations should be congenial. You're in the right mood to make the necessary decisions unhesitatingly.",
"You may get a bit frustrated in the morning because of a lack of commitment on the part of others, Leo. You may find it hard to pin down an answer when everything seems to be up in the air. The good news is that things should run much more smoothly by this evening and well into tonight. Note a major boost in emotional self-confidence now. After dark is definitely your time to shine.",
"Break open any door that seems to block you today, Leo. It won't take a great deal of effort on your part to accomplish this. The key is to be more flexible in your approach and merge with the group effort instead of trying to fight against it. You will find that when you open yourself to the people around you, there are a significant number who want to break down that same door.",
"Take a leap of faith today, Leo. Consider taking two or three. Trust that things will follow through perfectly. You will be drawn to those who put a smile on your face. These are the people you need to stick close to now. A positive attitude will lead you in a positive direction. Have fun with your life instead of getting depressed by it.",
"Are you sometimes afraid of appearing silly in front of people, Leo? The fear of failing in the eyes of others might be holding you back from real progress. The celestial energies are asking you to think about this carefully today. With all of your analytical strengths and abilities, just think of all that you could accomplish if you had the courage to take more risks!",
"A task that requires a lot of writing might have you discovering a new talent you never knew you had. You might be surprised, but you will want to develop this new skill. It could involve technology in some way, or it could entail working with money. A number of people could confer with you at some point during the day, Leo, perhaps asking advice about future business trends.",
"Are you interested in psychology? If so, you might discover some information that clues you in to your mental and emotional history. Such disciplines as past-life regression or rebirthing could be especially appealing. What you learn today could enable you to understand yourself better and release remnants of past traumas. The future will fill the gap with new, wonderful things!",
"You could be in an uncomfortable situation with friends today, Leo. There may be gossip going around about a mutual friend and you will be tempted to join in. Remember that repeated stories are rarely completely true. You would hate to lose a friendship if he or she found out you said something unflattering. Be careful. The people you're gossiping with may gossip about you later.",
"The planetary energy leaves you in a contemplative mood, Leo. A lot of different possibilities have opened up for you recently, and you're trying to figure out which is the most appropriate now. Sometimes it's better to let things churn around in your subconscious for a while, and this could be one of those times. Forget it for now and have fun.",
"A day off is just what the doctor ordered, Leo. Try to get some rest. Spend time curled up with a good book. Only go out with friends if you're feeling absolutely stir crazy. You should do no work. Your body and spirit crave a break. Take care of your basic need to refresh yourself. Everything else will fall into place afterward.",
"You may feel some frustration over your perceived inability to reach an important milestone in your career. It's possible that you only need to reevaluate the benchmarks you've set in order to see that you've made more progress than you thought. Remember, ultimately, the time it takes you to reach a goal matters less than the fact that you reach it.",
"Spend some quality time with your partner today, Leo. Perhaps he or she is a little jealous of your friends or feeling left out. Perhaps you've received invitations lately that are just for you. It might be a good idea to turn one down in favor of being with your partner. Plan a romantic interlude. A little quality time can help get things back on track.",
"There's a lot of work to be done today, and much of it centers on finances. Whether you're working on budgets or investments, you will easily finish the task. Your trusty computer will help you as you discover a new website that supports your efforts or post a question in a financial chatroom that yields many responses. Favorable advancement is likely, Leo, if not today then quite soon.",
"Are you working on a project that requires a little ingenuity? If so, today you may draw a blank. No matter how hard you think about it, you can't come up with a good way to proceed. Perhaps it would be best to put it away and do something else for a while. Trying to force the issue will only reinforce the mental blocks. Relax and let it come naturally in its own time.",
"Usually you're quite social, Leo, but today you will feel like nothing more than working alone. Notwithstanding your wishes, however, you might be plagued with phone calls, visitors, and people wanting advice or help. Don't fight it. Go with the flow. Take care of what you need to and then spend the evening alone. Everyone has days like this.",
"You may get frustrated when people who've taken shortcuts gain on your position, Leo. You believe that hard work is necessary to get where you need to go. You aren't afraid to expend the blood and sweat needed for success. You've planned well and you're on track. Try not to get upset by others who take the easy route. They may seem like they're gaining on you, but you're light-years ahead.",
"Today is excellent for you, Leo. You should be encouraged to take action in any artistic realm. Cook a scrumptious dinner and share it with a loved one. Give your heart a chance to speak and act on what it says. Your feminine and masculine sides are on the same page now. Take the opportunity to balance these two aspects. You're a magnet for love and romance.",
"Today is a terrific day for you, Leo. You have the chance to start over on many levels, especially romantic ones. Whether or not you're in a serious romantic relationship, you will find all your interactions with close friends and partners to be especially tender and meaningful. Strengthen your bond with the people around you and your inner core will be strengthened as a result.",
"Seize today, Leo. This is the day you've been waiting for. Don't back down from the intensity. You have the power to get ahead in whatever it is you wish to accomplish in this lifetime. You will find your willpower and discipline strong. It's time to grab the opportunities that are presented to you. Take the plunge toward a brighter future and be confident of your success.",
"Accomplishing some important business might require touching base with many people who live and work far away, perhaps in other countries. This might require that you spend a lot of time on the phone, and it also would require allowing for the different time zones, which could be a drag. You will eventually make the contacts you need, even if they don't come until tomorrow.",
"This would be an ideal day to take extra good care of your body, Leo. Don't kid yourself that those back problems will just go away - ditto that pain in your knee. Pick up the phone and make that appointment with the physical therapist. It won't hurt you to set aside your ambition and responsibilities for one day.",
"Hold tight to your money, Leo, because you may have some strange {though noble) impulses to give it away or spend a large amount on something completely useless. You should think about spending your money in a better way or, better yet, not at all. Why not consider donating some time rather than money to those in need?",
"Today you might be in the public eye along with some close friends and perhaps a love partner. You may be giving a speech, leading a discussion group, or be the center of attention at a party. You're likely to hold those around you spellbound, as your oratorical capabilities are very high. Enjoy the attention and make sure you give back what you get.",
"You could be introduced to a celebrity you admire, probably a woman, perhaps at a lecture or book signing, Leo. This could make a profound difference in your life, as this person may inspire you. A romantic partner could meet her as well, and the two of you should have a lot to discuss over dinner. Relax and enjoy your evening. It could change your life in a very subtle way.",
"If you've been doing some creative or job-related writing, today you might be tired, blocked, and unable to muster the energy to turn on the computer. Leo, you need to ask yourself how important it is to get it done today. It's far better to wait another day and do it well than grind out something that isn't up to your standards. That could be counterproductive.",
"The astral configuration indicates that you can expect a financial windfall of some sort, Leo! This is great, but don't celebrate just yet. While it seems likely that your income is going to increase through a raise or bonus, there are signs that the money isn't immediately forthcoming. Continue to live as usual, though with the satisfaction of knowing that things are going to improve soon.",
"You might be surprised by how clever and creative you are today, Leo. Just for fun, you may decide to pick up a paintbrush and try watercolor painting or perhaps writing some poetry. Whatever you attempt, you can be fairly sure that it will work out favorably. Your creative muse is there on your shoulder and waiting for you to make use of her!",
"A luxury you've been craving could seem very tempting today, Leo. Make sure you're really ready, willing, and able to spend the money to get it. Think about it carefully before whipping out your credit card. Do you really want it that much? Is the expense feasible right now? If so, go for it. Luxuries aren't always a waste of money. They can do wonders for your self-esteem!",
"Here's a suggestion. If you get a strange vibe about a situation today, walk away, Leo. Your instincts will tell you if something is dangerous or not. If you don't feel safe, find another place to be. You won't be productive in an environment where you don't feel comfortable. You will also enjoy yourself much more if you can relax in the situation instead of being uptight about it.",
"An unexpected sum of money could come your way today, Leo. It probably won't be large, but it will be welcome nonetheless. Perhaps someone has owed you money for a long time and finally repays it. Or you might sell an item you've wanted to unload for a long time. Whatever it is, you might want to take a friend to dinner. Go for it and have fun!",
"Money matters may seem up in the air today, Leo. Your usual practicality may desert you. This could make you stressed and angry because you're perfectly capable of dealing with your finances. Don't worry. The vagueness should pass by tomorrow. In the meantime, get some help, or if your concerns aren't too urgent, wait a day or two. Give yourself a break.",
"Uncomfortable intuitive impressions from someone close might be troubling, Leo. Is your friend ill or bothered by events out of his or her control? Your friend probably won't want to talk much about it, so you will just have to let them tell you what's going on when the time is right. This could be frustrating for you, but be patient. That's all you can do now.",
"There are no half measures today, Leo. You feel every emotion to the nth degree. This could make for an intense day. Make an effort to calm down. Rather than inject your opinion into every conversation, make it a point to step away from the group. The talk is animated enough without you stirring things up further. Spend the evening with loved ones. They will be more tolerant of your mood.",
"You may receive some important information today. This message could have a dramatic ripple effect on your life. You may change jobs or even move to a different part of the country, all as a result of the information you receive. You may be nervous about making such dramatic changes to your life, but trust that they're for the better. Dare to take the risk, Leo.",
"Don't hesitate to say the obvious today, Leo, even if it sounds corny. Many times people hesitate to say what they really feel because they think it's obvious to everyone. The truth of the matter is that most people aren't mind readers and probably aren't picking up on the subtle signals that you send out. Help them by speaking frankly.",
"You clean house like someone with an attention problem, Leo. You never stick with one task. Your bathroom mirrors and counters will get cleaned, but not the floor. Make an effort to clean thoroughly, one room at a time. Even if you don't get through the whole house, you will receive some satisfaction from knowing that parts of it are spotless.",
"You've been hoping for a quiet day on the job, Leo, but too many calls could come your way. You might have to juggle several at once. Don't try to deal with every problem. Exercise your triage abilities and take care of the most pressing first. Let the others go, if necessary. You aren't doing anyone any favors by getting too distracted. Even you can be less than thorough when overwhelmed.",
"You have a generous spirit, Leo, which could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. When you get a gift of money or even a hint of one, your tendency is to buy presents for all your friends. It's hard to fault you for this, but there are other ways to show your affection. You could bake cookies to distribute, for example. This will keep your money safe and earning interest.",
"You have a to-do list a mile long today, Leo. You may spend a lot of your day running errands. It certainly takes a lot to run a household, as you no doubt realize. Try not to get overwhelmed with all that you feel needs to be done. Most of the deadlines are self-imposed. No one will know if you don't meet them.",
"You can be known for needing a lot of love, but you will never admit that to yourself, much less anyone else. Sometimes it seems as if you like feeling emotionally frustrated. Today is the perfect day to meditate about whether or not this is true of you. Do you talk to other people about your emotional needs?",
"Your judgment about people relies too much on general opinion, Leo. As soon as you meet someone, you accept what others think about him or her without trying to find out more. This lack of curiosity could lead you to make a hasty decision about someone today. If you take the time to listen with your heart, you could be impressed by what you hear.",
"Your psychic abilities and imagination are operating at a very high level, Leo. You face other people with a profound, spiritual love. They will return it! You might want to write down your thoughts or draw pictures of whatever pops into your mind, even if you don't feel you have talent. It's more important to keep a record for you than set things down for posterity.",
"Today you may be anxious to spend time with your family, Leo, but there could be some chores you need to do first. This could stress you out quite a bit if you let it. Roll up your sleeves and handle whatever needs to be done and then hightail it back to your hEarth. Relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones!",
"Abandon the myth that you don't have any gifts or means at your disposal, Leo. The proof is that you have your body. Are you taking care of yourself? Do you exercise? Do you take care of minor health issues? All of these questions are related. You regard your gifts the same way you regard your body.",
"You've been doing a lot of cleaning up and clearing out. Since this project has been going on for several years now, you must be doing a particularly thorough job. Finally, it seems as if you're getting things straight with your karma. Today will be a big day, Leo. You may be able to leave part of your childhood behind, as at last you understand that it's ancient history.",
"There are some wonderful surprises in store for you, Leo. They could come in the form of a new career opportunity or potential dates. With the current planetary aspects, you can avail yourself of the best ways to find personal and professional fulfillment. Don't hesitate to be original. That quality will trump everything else!",
"Today could discourage even the most ardent of passions, Leo. Even if some people say you're a bit cold, know that there's a veritable volcano burning underneath all that ice. Today you may once again find yourself at a distance from your feelings, as if you were regaining control over your emotions. Be careful about being too cynical about things.",
"If you have someone special in your life, Leo, today is a perfect day to stop playing at being your partner's parent, as you sometimes seem to do. Reverse roles, and let other people take care of you. The world won't fall apart if you let go for a while. No matter what happens, a day like today should open your eyes.",
"Conflict over money could get in the way of your usual cordial relationships, Leo. Attention to the household budget is definitely needed. Unexpected events may require some immediate purchases that you hadn't planned on. They might require some scrimping, but you should be able to minimize the need if you plan carefully. Don't make yourself crazy over anything today. You will get through it!",
"A reunion with a family member who has been away or out of touch could generate some powerful emotions, Leo. Memories could come flooding back, making you both nostalgic and maybe a bit angry. Take care to curb the latter. You don't want to spoil your reunion. Take a long, objective look at the memories and try to figure out what they mean to you now. Then let them go.",
"The desire for independence may have some family members thinking about breaking out on their own. Others could desire to make some extra money for their own projects. Your house could be busy today, if you're in it at all. Don't be surprised if everyone spends most of the day somewhere else.",
"Today may be filled with \"I told you so!\" You could find fault with others who haven't dealt with the truth of a situation. Be careful about accusing someone of the very thing that you're guilty of, Leo. Penetrating emotions will cut to the heart of the matter, and there will be no way to escape the hole you dig for yourself. Don't criticize others when until you take an honest look at yourself.",
"No one likes rejection, but no one likes rejection less than you, Leo. You may hesitate to take risks in the unknown. Keep in mind that by playing it safe, you deprive yourself of the very adventure that could turn your life around. There's an energetic, expansive feeling in the air encouraging you to take that leap of faith. This energy may feel foreign to you, but it's time to embrace it.",
"You may wonder why all the attention isn't focused on you, Leo. Perhaps you feel cheated and irritable. The more annoyed you get, the more you will drive others away instead of draw them to you. Rather than get upset or angry because attention isn't coming your way, join with the prevailing happy-go-lucky mood. You will find that your whole day turns around for the better.",
"A lot of activity could take place around home today. It could involve a number of visitors, or it could simply be a lot of work that needs doing. Either way, you might feel a bit frazzled, and the temptation to run away from it all might be almost irresistible. Relax! There's no need to stress out. Just do what needs to be done and enjoy the rest of the day.",
"You can look forward to an enjoyable day, Leo. Neither family matters nor career issues will cloud your spirit, as everything seems to be proceeding smoothly and according to plan. Moreover, the day's aspects seem to be inviting you to be a little more adventurous than usual. Any artistic or romantic undertaking will be especially fulfilling.",
"Prepare for a somewhat stressful day, Leo. Your family life may be marred by some disagreements. There's some likelihood you will feel as though your territory is being invaded and your range of action limited. But you have no intention of surrendering. You've a right to a room of your own. You will fight for it tooth and nail!",
"Low biorhythms could have you feeling a little depressed. You may tend to doubt your goals and abilities. Don't let this send you into a fit of gloom, Leo. All is better than it seems. Realize that today you're likely to blow every little setback out of proportion. Give everything you try your very best effort. Go out tonight and have a good time!",
"This is a contemplative day, Leo. You seem to be developing new techniques, means, therapies, and methods to use in your main occupation. Today you're likely to question your underlying reasons for so much innovation. Why reinvent the world? Although you may not make any major changes in your activities, you could find new justifications for them.",
"You don't have to answer to society's cultural values, Leo. If most of your work is organized around an activity that's considered fashionable, you will never succeed in feeling good about yourself or your creations. You're too motivated by meaningful activities to spend your time with frivolous ones. Today's aspects will push you to cut yourself off from all that doesn't resonate deeply.",
"Are you ready, Leo? Are you in shape for what's going to happen? The celestial aspects are heralding a new cycle that will be filled to the brim with activities, new people, and new professional perspectives. Let's hope that you've been able to rest up lately. If you haven't, try to schedule in some afternoon naps!",
"Some good but surprising news could come your way today, Leo. Perhaps a family member or friend will call or drop by with a surprising development that directly affects you. In the evening, go out together and celebrate. Don't forget to include your special someone in your celebration plans.",
"An invitation to an important social event could come today, Leo. This could represent a chance to meet important people who could advance your career or who might be involved in a field that interests you. Your energy and enthusiasm won't be lost on these people, or anyone for that matter, as you will obviously be speaking from the heart when you discuss what's on your mind.",
"You're likely to be faced with conflicting reports today, Leo. Information may be tainted with emotion, so be careful about going with the choice that shouts the loudest. You may get pigeonholed into a place you don't want to be in. Heed the internal warnings you pick up. This is a good day to work and play with passion. Take care of any investigative work that needs to be done.",
"Expect to have to make some adjustments in your love life, Leo. You may be in a different frame of mind than your partner. Why not use the day to step back from the relationship? Spend time apart for a change. After all, there's nothing dramatic about the fact that your needs and desires aren't in sync. It's only temporary.",
"You need to learn an important lesson in follow-through, Leo. As you strive for perfection, you may get the feeling that nothing is ever fully completed. Try not to be so hard on yourself. The work you've finished so far is more than likely much better than what most people could ever accomplish. Put the final touches on whatever you're doing and move on.",
"There may be a bit of tension and conflict in your world today, Leo. Be prepared for mild contention that could turn into an all-out war if you aren't careful. Don't take things too personally. Think of these disputes as challenges that will only make you stronger when you overcome them. Don't get disgruntled or evasive. Running away won't do any good.",
"The planetary energies are encouraging you to make some adjustments regarding your social ambitions. You may desire to change professions or your circle of friends. This is trickier than you might think, as the culture of your current world is an extension of you. You're drawn to what's familiar. Your natural tendency will be to go back to where you came from.",
"You may get the feeling that despite all the hard work you've accomplished, something is still missing, Leo. There's still a long road ahead, regardless of the goals you've attained so far. Perhaps the thing you're searching for is a tender moment with a loved one, something that's much closer than you think. Stop searching far and wide for the thing that's right under your nose.",
"It's a good day to express your thoughts and feelings, Leo. Whether it's a loved one who'd appreciate affectionate words or a colleague who requires instruction, communication will come more easily than usual. You have a practical nature. Often you say what you think is required and not much else. Yet others may need you to say a lot more. Consider this as you go about your day.",
"You may get caught up in gossip if you aren't careful, Leo, and people may find this off-putting. The maturity level of the conversation is apt to drop significantly if you insist on talking about others like they're soap opera characters. Build your self-confidence so you're comfortable and you don't need to use other people's lives as topics of discussion.",
"Hold on to your wallet, Leo, because you may have some strange {though noble) impulses to give away your money or spend a large amount on something useless. You should think about spending your money in a better way or not at all. Why not consider donating some of your time rather than money to those in need?",
"What looks like solid ground may be quicksand, Leo. Be careful where you step. There's an element of misunderstanding to the day that might make it difficult to get through to people. The good news is that your emotions are quite solid. Your inner stability should help you keep a healthy frame of mind, regardless of the events that transpire.",
"The signs say that you can expect a very profitable few weeks ahead, Leo. You've worked hard lately, and it's only natural that you have finally arrived at this stage. You're going to be able to measure the distance you've come and evaluate your power. Whatever you do, don't think small!",
"While this may be a day when all you want to do is to relax, you may not feel like you can, Leo. A little voice is telling you to work. Perhaps you're inspired to clean out your closet, change the landscaping, or wash your windows. Put these tasks aside. Forced manual labor isn't the way to go today. If you're going to put that much energy into something, put it into having fun.",
"Have some fun today, Leo. It's time to balance all the work you've been doing with a little bit of fun. Yesterday's honest efforts are turning into today's rewards. There's no need to be shy when it comes to receiving what is rightfully yours. Be proud of your accomplishments. If you can't find someone to take you out to dinner, take yourself out!",
"Your mind should be clear today and communications should go extremely well for you, Leo. Very few words will be needed to get your point across. You will connect to people on many levels. Realize that you have important information to share with those around you. Your critical, practical, grounded opinion plays a key role in the activities of the day.",
"Unless you want to get into an intellectual sparring match today, you might want to stay home, Leo. But this battle of wits could also take place in your own kitchen, so perhaps you should take a long walk by yourself and avoid others. Or simply prepare for battle. People aren't apt to be very sympathetic to your cause, so wear your armor.",
"Today can be an extremely productive day, Leo. You're in a good space from which to work and this will aid you in all your endeavors. Today is also excellent for looking at some of the long-term trends moving through your life now. Consider the next five or ten years and think about how your actions will affect your future. Plan ahead to get ahead.",
"Today isn't a day to stay inside and sulk, Leo. Put the past behind you and move on. Grab opportunities with both hands and rev your engine into high gear. Stop looking at what lies behind and focus on the wide-open horizon in front of you. This is an excellent day to turn up the heat and start brewing some new adventures. Transform your life into an action movie with you as the star.",
"Tune into the aggressive energy of today, Leo, and use it to push your intentions forward. Today's emotional intensity will bring you to your knees if you aren't careful. The secret is to harness the energy and use it to your advantage. Try not to get caught between the crossfire of conflict. Tap into the slow-moving, generous force that's helping you ground your thoughts and emotions.",
"You should feel a renewed sense of confidence today that will help anchor your emotions and give strength to your thoughts and ideas, Leo. Don't take a pessimistic attitude toward everything around you. Look at the good instead of the bad. By maintaining a negative viewpoint about things, you're only adding to the problem. You have every right to be happy.",
"Don't worry so much about getting things done today, Leo. Instead, concentrate on your feelings and relationships. A caring, sensitive attitude is needed, as opposed to a harsh, militant way of dealing with things. You will find that by adopting a tender, nurturing tone, people will be much more receptive to you in general.",
"Things probably aren't going to go exactly as you planned today, Leo. Realize that people may act in erratic, powerful bursts, especially when it comes to emotional issues. Your feelings may be a bit distant, and you may find it hard to get in touch with what's really going on inside you. Do your best to maintain a positive attitude. That's all anyone can ask.",
"Do your thing today, Leo, and don't take garbage from others. Take control of the issue when you see that something needs to get done. Others may be acting rashly and see things differently than you do. Don't change your point of view just to make it easier on others. If people are in your way, confront them.",
"People and situations egg you on today, Leo. It may seem like there's contention around every corner. Remember that your path is the one that you chose. You may or may not have anticipated the barriers, but they're unavoidable. The key to success is to strike the right balance between inner and outer activities. Don't direct all your frustration at others. Don't hold it all in, either.",
"Your heightened sensitivity could get you in trouble today, Leo. The more you try to pin down a specific answer to something, the more resistance you may encounter. Don't expect a straight answer from anyone or you will be disappointed. People may be flighty or forgetful. Try not to take anything too seriously today.",
"You have the tendency to plan everything, Leo. You need to feel in charge of things. Today you should try to listen to others around you. Let yourself go for a while, even though you aren't used to it. Furthermore, you need to develop your personality. You can do this by opening up to others.",
"You're very tolerant toward a particular person in your entourage, which is probably due to your generous nature, Leo. You think everyone should have his or her own experiences and setbacks. After all, we learn from our mistakes. Sometimes you aren't very humble, but your friends are lucky to have someone they can count on.",
"Today you may have to commit to some values close to your heart, Leo. As a child, you were aware of the role you had to play in society. You were greatly concerned about others. Today you will probably be asking yourself if you should get involved and make decisions in the general interest.",
"Take time out to change the things in your life that need restoring, Leo. Explore your emotional needs and find ways to satisfy them. You may need to adopt a radically different approach in order to get where you need to go. Even if things seem unstable at first, they're likely to smooth out and be much more dependable eventually. Be an individual.",
"You have a tremendous ability to understand the inner workings of any situation, Leo. You may need to give someone a reality check to make sure they're on the same page as you. Use your criticism constructively so you don't alienate yourself from the people. Help to fill in the blanks in a situation that isn't fully understood by all parties, and move the project to the next level.",
"Put your reservations aside, Leo, and go for the thing your heart desires most. Throw caution to the wind and make it happen. Today's energy urges you to take charge of your life and conquer new territory. There's dynamism about the day that could leave you behind unless you latch onto the trend and make it work for you.",
"Don't be quick to criticize today, Leo. Keep things positive and think about how you can compliment someone. Your heart might need a bit more attention than usual, so surround yourself with people who bring your spirits up rather than drag them down. If you're always looking to the future, you may not realize all the wonderful things happening in the present.",
"It's time to put your plans in motion, Leo. There's a very expansive energy urging you to reach out and make valuable connections with others. Remember that many hands make light work. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. There are many outstretched hands waiting to help you in whatever way you need.",
"Love is in the air, Leo! You may encounter some wonderfully passionate situations today. You're ready to live these marvelously rich and emotional experiences to the fullest. Put your doubts and insecurities away for the time being. Lose yourself in pleasure and the unknown. Have a great time!",
"A group you're affiliated with could find some discrepancies in their financial records and ask you to check into it, Leo. This is probably due more to mistaken entries or lost pages than to any major disaster, but solving it will set everyone's mind at ease. Don't be surprised if you have to dig through little scraps of paper buried in the bottom of files. It will be worth it, though.",
"Worries about a relative who lives far away might plague you today, Leo. The situation isn't helped by the fact that you may not be able to reach them by phone or email. You may have to contact mutual friends who can give you the information you need. Circumstances probably aren't all that dire. There's probably nothing to be overly concerned about, but you need to hear this. Keep trying.",
"Some paperwork might need execution today, Leo. This may be tedious, but it's apt to open new doors for you and pave the way to more success and good fortune. Writing or speaking might be involved in some way, and modern technology plays a definite part in what you will be doing. This could lead to valuable contacts and new friendships. Explore your options.",
"Your financial situation should continue to expand now, Leo. Believe in yourself. Don't worry if you hear rumors that make the future seem rather grim. This is probably misinformation coming from unreliable sources. Continue to work toward your goals. Meanwhile, check out the rumors and find the real facts. You will probably discover that all is far better than the gossipers claim.",
"The high from your recent successes could make you want to purchase luxury items that you used to think were impractical, Leo. This is fine as long as you're discriminating and don't give in to impulse buying. This also isn't a good time to overindulge in food or drink. You should let yourself enjoy your success while still using common sense.",
"Romance blossoms for you, Leo, perhaps after a long standstill. A new stability and security may settle on love relationships as well as close friendships. Children could be a great source of warmth and pleasure. You might want to channel some of this blossoming positive energy into a creative activity of some kind, which should increase even further your sense of contentment and well-being.",
"Some mysterious telephone calls might come your way - wrong numbers or hang-ups. Other people might seem less communicative than usual, Leo, and you may be preoccupied. You might feel a bit more nervous than usual, but that should go away if you take a walk or get some other exercise. If you've been thinking about doing some writing, this is the day to start.",
"Enjoy yourself, Leo. You have a lot to be grateful for, so give thanks. Take pride in all you've accomplished so far and share your joy with others. Let go of the reins and sit back comfortably for a while. You've worked hard for a reason - to enjoy life. If you don't do it now, then when? Take time out and be with loved ones tonight.",
"A close friend or member of your household could be having money problems, Leo, and might want to draw upon your business sense in order to make sense of the situation and find ways to put it right. As you're likely to be feeling especially sensitive to the needs of others, you could be of valuable assistance to this person and anyone else who needs some insight.",
"The world is wide open to you today, Leo, so take advantage of all the great things it has to offer. Even though you may not realize it, you have a loyal fan club developing in the wings. The things you say and do have a strong impact on others. This is a fantastic day to take charge and lead others who seem to be floundering. Your solid perspective will be an asset in every situation.",
"If the doorknob doesn't turn today, Leo, don't force it. You will only break it. Perhaps you need to try another door. If things don't flow smoothly into place, then they probably weren't meant to be. Life shouldn't always be a struggle. Your job is to enjoy it. Remember that the next time you're in a long line. View the situation as a period of rest.",
"Try to align your mind with your emotions today, Leo. It's possible that a powerful yet subtle force is slowly pulling you off track. If so, you should think about taking a break and doing some fast-paced physical activity to get your heart rate up and blood pumping. Jogging will help clear your head and enable you to think more rationally about decisions you need to make.",
"Take a break from your steady climb today, Leo. Look at things around you. Enjoy a night out with friends and take an active role in the conversation. See a movie or play. Do more socializing and you will be able to release some of the tension that you might not even realize you have inside. Get the energy moving again. Take an active role and keep up with the beat.",
"Enlist the help of others today, Leo. Information exchange is key to putting the last few puzzle pieces into place. Doing things on your own is important and necessary, but at some point you need to realize that the next major step requires a certain amount of input from others. Gather data and apply it to your situation. Don't become a leech or burden to others.",
"Don't run away from the tension today, Leo. Any emotional stress you feel will be compounded if it isn't dealt with right away. Be in the moment while the moment is here. The more you face the present, the less you will regret in the future. Clear up any sticky situation that arises and move forward. People may not understand your needs and concerns until you clearly verbalize them.",
"Your dreams will never come true unless you believe in and act on them, Leo. No one else is going to do it for you. Unless you have a fairy godmother, you need to take matters into your own hands. Realize that you can get there many different ways. The first step is always to believe in yourself and the fact that anything is possible. Today is a great day to let your imagination take charge.",
"Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems alone, Leo. Just talking things out with others may help shed light on a situation that baffled you earlier. Enlist the help of others in areas where you need it. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance. We all have problems and issues to deal with. You aren't alone.",
"If you're talking about another person today, Leo, don't say anything that would upset them if they were standing next to you. Gossip may run rampant, but that's no excuse to contribute to it. Be aware that what you say has a strong impact on the people around you. It's likely to spread to many more ears than you think.",
"You may feel a restriction to the day, but in truth, this is for your own good, Leo. Your sense of discipline comes in handy as you tackle your work with incredible enthusiasm. Your goals aren't far from your reach. Stay focused and don't get pressured by the ticking clock. Hastiness will lead to careless mistakes. If you're going to do a job, do it right the first time.",
"Take a time-out today and relax a little, Leo. Let your romantic nature have some fun. Don't feel guilty about not being as serious as you think you should be. The day's winner is the one who can smile the most. Enter this contest with the intention of winning. The rewards will last a long time. The people you encounter won't be able to help but smile back.",
"You have hidden talents that may be revealed to you today, Leo. Perhaps collaboration with someone new has you doing things you never thought you could. Perhaps you discover a talent for writing, graphic design, or money management. You can't help but delight in this discovery, as it opens up a world of new possibilities. You don't need to take action now. Revel in your untapped potential.",
"Lock into the practical, grounding force of the day that is not only realistic but also flexible. Attend to details and organize yourself, Leo. Be aware that you may need to alter your course a bit in order to fit the group dynamic. Try to work with those around you to achieve a common goal. Initiating the help of others is easier than you think as long as you stay focused and motivated.",
"Your plans may be upended today, Leo, but this doesn't mean that you should give up hope in any way. Sometimes it's necessary to let go of control and simply let things happen as they will. Adopt a spirit of adventure and take risks that you normally may not want to take. There is a distinct advantage in spontaneity and working harmoniously with the unexpected events that are bound to occur.",
"Now is the perfect time to say something you've been meaning to say for quite a while, Leo. Get it out in the open. Keeping it inside is only eating away at your internal mechanisms. Stop worrying about the consequences and make the move. Today is a day to be bold and aggressive. Other people might respond similarly, so if you dish it out, be sure you can take it.",
"An invitation to an important social event could come today, Leo. This may be a chance to meet important people who could advance your career in some way or who might be involved in a field that interests you. Your own energy and enthusiasm won't be lost on them. You will obviously be speaking from the heart when you discuss what's on your mind.",
"Do you have a desire to take a trip far from where you live, Leo? Would you like to live in Europe or Asia? These are desires that you may have at the moment because you're in the process of widening your field of possibilities. See if you can seriously set up a project of this kind. People will be confident in your solidity at the moment.",
"Your normal steady pace usually wins the race, Leo, but today you might need to take some shortcuts. Jump on opportunities that seem to come out of nowhere, but don't feel like you need to commit to anything now. Take your chances and see where luck takes you. There's an adventurous spirit in the air urging you to take an unexpected gamble.",
"You're ready for dramatic change in your life, Leo. It isn't that you're dissatisfied with your career or personal life. Rather, you feel like you're missing out on something great, if you only knew what. Be receptive to whatever opportunities arise and explore them all. You may find the answers you seek through travel or more education. Bring a friend if you're afraid to explore on your own.",
"The warrior within may be stirred today. You might also have some self-doubt about your actions, Leo. Stay confident that you're on the right path at all times. There may be a bit of tension in your world, but try not to get too worked up over it. This is just a passing phase. You shouldn't overreact and think that you're completely wrong regarding something you're doing.",
"Searching for the hidden meaning in things may be a waste of time, Leo. Go with the flow and have fun. The more you relax, the more relaxed people will be around you. It will make for better chemistry in general, regardless of whom you're with. You need to be a friend if you want to make friends. Don't turn everyone into your enemy. Take the chance to get to know them.",
"Check your stocks today, Leo. Read the latest investment news and assess your finances. Figure out the best place to put your hard-earned money. Do some serious long-term planning to make sure your home and family are secure. Take a reserved, stable approach in all your dealings with others, and spend a comfortable evening at home with someone you love.",
"Your tremendous sensitivity in a certain situation could be causing you to jump to conclusions that are keeping you from seeing the truth, Leo. Your tendency is to assume things before you have all the facts. You may assume the worst, making you more stressed about the situation than you need to be. Don't worry about things you don't know to be true.",
"Talking things over with friends is likely to be a nourishing exercise for you, Leo. Instead of trying to work things out in your head, say them aloud and ask others for their perspectives. A tremendous amount of healing can take place when you confess what's bothering you. Find the relief that comes from having a willing listener.",
"There's extra action in your day today, Leo, so go with it. Don't fight against the wave of unconventional support that's brewing at your back door. There's a great deal of potential energy at your disposal. The only thing keeping you from harnessing it is your own mind. Don't be so scared of that which can actually help you out. Open your mind and let the new into your life.",
"Your mastery of your mind and ability to stay disciplined about your goals is impressive, Leo. Others recognize and appreciate your efforts much more than usual. You may be called upon to assist in some other project or someone else's emotional drama because you have the stability required to remedy the situation. Don't downplay your talent in this area.",
"If you know you've wronged another, admit it immediately, Leo. People are often quick to point out when others make mistakes, but it's the rare individual who points out their own mistakes. Demonstrate that you're strong and honorable enough to say when you've done wrong. Integrity will get you far in life, whereas deception and retreating from difficult situations will not.",
"Get in touch with a friend you haven't heard from in a while, Leo. Someone is waiting to hear from you. Surprise him or her with an unexpected expression of love. Rely on your inner map and don't let others throw you off course. Don't waste time. Keep an eye on your goals at all times. Other people play key parts in making this day go smoothly, but don't let them manipulate you.",
"Something might be shaking the very ground you stand on, Leo. Just when you thought everything was calm and stable, suddenly the ground begins to rumble. Secure your footing, hold on, and stay flexible. A few steps in a different direction may position you in a safe area where you can ride out the storm with no problem. Becoming too fixed and rigid would be a bad idea.",
"Don't be surprised if emotions flare up between you and someone close on a professional or social level, Leo. The issue may be difficult to resolve now. People feel rather sensitive. If they hear something they don't like, especially an opinion that may seem too critical, they're likely to shut down. You might want to consider saving anything of a sensitive nature for tomorrow.",
"A wonderful day lies ahead, Leo. Life is giving you more space and freedom at the moment. You could take advantage of this space to do something with your creativity. It's the perfect time to sign up for some art classes or just begin something on your own, like singing, painting, or writing. What would you like to do? Do it!",
"Leo, today you may have to make some important decisions. You're demanding of your friends and loved ones. Have you ever thought about why? It's possible that you demand more of them than you do of yourself, and that doesn't seem fair, does it? Today insight and inspiration will show you how you can rectify this. Lower your standards for others or raise your standards for yourself. Level the playing field.",
"Perhaps you can't believe it, but it's time to say goodbye to your rigid attitude. A little pleasure among all that seriousness and responsibility won't do you any harm. This day could help you change your point of view on life. This will feel great!",
"You may find that other people are the missing variable in the equation that you seek answers to today, Leo. Don't feel like you have to come up with all the details and resolutions yourself. Work with those who also have something to contribute to the situation at hand. A quiet, disciplined approach is exactly what's needed to plow through any problem that needs fixing.",
"You may feel confused, Leo. If so, take a breath and slow down. Being frantic will only run you in circles. Your heart and mind are buzzing in all directions, so try to settle down. Don't feel like you need to come up with any particular solutions. Trying to pin things down will only frustrate you and waste your time.",
"Money problems may seem to be escalating, Leo, and you could be hard-pressed to find a way to deal with them right now. The situation is temporary. Put all paperwork aside for now. If you wait a day until you're feeling a little less stressed, you'll be able to get a better handle on the situation and juggle your budget in order to make it all work.",
"Today the walls may seem to be closing in around you, and you're anxious to get out for a while, Leo. Your significant other could want nothing more than to stay in. Don't let this turn into a major issue. Find a compromise. Go out to dinner and then come home and watch TV. Enjoy your time together! If single, get out and mingle.",
"An unhappy visitor, probably a woman, could come to your home today, Leo. This person has a lot of anger right now and probably won't make much of a conversationalist. If you can't make your excuses, put on some music or perhaps a funny movie. You might be surprised at the results! Some soothing chords or a few laughs might accomplish wonders. Be clever!",
"Your adventurous side could show itself, Leo. You might have a talent for an activity you never considered before, such as rafting, flying, mountain climbing, or skydiving! Or it could be a less risky pastime that's still new to you. This is a good time to tackle new projects of any kind. Just make sure you know all the ins and outs before getting started.",
"Memories from your past could resurface, Leo. You might wonder why you're suddenly thinking about them, but they probably represent a release of old emotional hang-ups that have been holding you back. By midafternoon you should feel more focused, determined, and ready to take on just about anything. This is definitely a great day to start new projects or complete old ones.",
"The absence of direct expressions of love might make your life seem rather empty today, Leo. If you're single, there may be nobody around to have fun with. If you're involved, chances are your current love interest is unable to get together. Don't waste time fretting over this. Make some other plans.",
"Today you might feel a little out of sorts, Leo, perhaps because of overindulgence from last night. You might be tempted to stay home in spite of other commitments. This actually might be a wise course of action, though you may feel better by midafternoon. Spend the morning relaxing and taking care of yourself. See what the rest of the day brings.",
"Be careful about planning things too much, Leo. Leave the morning open for spontaneous acts and haphazard events. Let the structure of the afternoon slowly evolve from the morning's events. You don't need to build Rome in a day. Enjoy a leisurely morning, and see if you can convince someone to bring you breakfast in bed. This is the perfect way to start the day.",
"Ingenuity and practicality lead to success now. Something may be accomplished that has meant a lot to you, Leo, and you should feel particularly satisfied with yourself and maybe even a little excited. A lot of comings and goings could take place in the home today, with visitors and family members popping in and out. Stay centered.",
"Something unusual could put a smile on your face today, Leo. Look for beauty and love in the simplest things. If you can't see it, then work on adjusting your attitude. Your inner state is likely what needs to be fixed, not the world around you. If you can shift to a light, understanding mood, you'll receive the laughter and romance that are sure to brighten your day.",
"You may find it hard to admit that you can't do everything, Leo. There are some jobs that you aren't cut out to do. Why pretend when a better option would be to delegate the task to someone else? If you don't feel a strong connection with something or someone, don't force it. Pretending that you're capable of something will only cause frustration for you and everyone else.",
"Getting along with others may prove challenging today, Leo. The planetary aspects can have you isolating yourself. You might feel impatient and easily annoyed. If this is so, stay solo if you can. If you can't, you'll need to curb a tendency to be argumentative or confrontational. Exercise patience and bite your tongue if that's what it takes. Avoid conflict.",
"If you're trying to prove you have something valuable to offer, Leo, think this through. You're naturally friendly and can get along with almost anyone. This may already be your strength, and you probably have something great to bring to a crowd. Consider just being you and not always trying to feel a part of things. Start by looking at your good qualities to prove your worth to yourself.",
"You may feel like you aren't getting the attention you need or deserve, Leo. Because of this, you may resent the people you feel you should be getting it from. This attitude is likely to make people less likely to come to your rescue. Who wants to be around someone so needy and unhappy? Focus on yourself and your own healing before you take your issues to others.",
"Make yourself available to someone in need of a friend, Leo. Don't turn anyone away even if you're busy or under the weather. Chances are the person who comes to you needs the advice and support that only you can offer. Listening doesn't take that much energy, and that may be all that's required. Leave yourself open to others.",
"Upsetting news about money may come your way today, Leo. This could involve your personal finances or economic factors in general that indirectly affect your finances. Don't panic. All may not be as it seems! Check the facts before acting. The situation could be real, but it's more likely the product of overblown journalism. Don't believe everything you read.",
"Don't be surprised if you getting back into the swing of things more slowly than usual today, Leo. Not every day starts off with a bang, so don't be too hard on yourself for this. Just take things slow and easy. If you have a deadline, consider asking for a short extension. Pushing yourself to get things accomplished can leave you feeling even less productive.",
"Today brings the opportunity to see things as they are and not as you'd like them to be. It's easy to fool yourself sometimes, but you can only get away with that for so long before the truth comes out. There comes a time when you need to face things. Any time is an excellent time to start fresh. Take your time and trust in yourself.",
"Confusion surrounds financial matters today, Leo. Someone close to you could be hit with unexpected expenses, and this person might ask you for a loan. You'll want to help out, but no matter what they say, it doesn't look like their situation is going to improve anytime soon. If you decide to lend the money, accept that you won't see it again for a while.",
"There may be a bit of restlessness due to strong forces urging you to take action, Leo. A dynamic feeling is in the air and calling on you to get up and get moving. Take this opportunity to push through some of your new ideas. Make strides toward the completion of your goals. Don't let your emotions get in the way of your mental processes.",
"Old emotions could well up from your unconscious today, Leo. Your nerves could be on edge. You might even lose your temper on occasion. Stop and take a look at why you're upset. Consider what's coming up from the past and then release it. You'll be amazed at how quickly you return to normal. You might be able to get some work done!",
"Technology could set a personal or job-related project back for you today, Leo. Computers, telephones, or other important equipment could malfunction and necessitate calling in a repairperson. Too many people could vie for your attention and make demands on you, causing you to feel distracted. The temptation to lose your temper and walk out could be strong. Don't do it.",
"Try not to be harsh and judgmental today, Leo. You don't understand others' perspectives and the codes they live by. Differences are no reason to find fault with people. You have a powerful personality that's perceptive and creative. Use these gifts in a positive, healthy manner instead of using them to get down on others and their behavior.",
"Stop planning and start doing. There may be pressure to leave your normal routine and do something on a whim, Leo. Although this may not be your usual way to do things, it certainly isn't a reason not to. Let your mind explore new realms. Feel free to pick up loose pieces of an old dream that you left hanging in midair. Rekindle your passion for life.",
"Do you sometimes go about things backward, Leo? Are you caught up in the rat race of trying to have more money and security with the idea that eventually you'll earn the freedom to do what makes you happy? The happiness factor actually works in reverse. You must first be who you are and then take the necessary actions in order to have what you really want.",
"Don't overreact today, Leo. Your biorhythms are low. In fact, you may be feeling a bit under the weather. There's no point in trying to keep up a cheerful front. People will see through your facade. You would be better served by spending time on solo activities. That way you can spend long stretches of time in bed, where you're meant to be today.",
"You're energetic and enthusiastic today, Leo, and those around you respond favorably. It seems everyone wants to be in your orbit. Work at home and the office goes quickly and smoothly. Because you have so much energy, why not take on a new project? Normally this would send you over the edge, but today you feel you could take on anything. Go for it.",
"Some vivid dreams could shed light on something you've been trying to find, Leo. This could be a lost object or an obscure piece of information. Whatever it is, you might wake up with some new ideas on where to look for it. Chances are it's hidden in an obvious place full of similar things. Don't hesitate because of the unorthodox source of your insight.",
"Some disconcerting information you receive today from a group you're affiliated with could have you wondering if you have a future with this group, Leo. This might be disillusioning for you, but this isn't a good day to make any decisions. Wait a few days and then consider what you heard today objectively and assess its impact. You'll be in a far better frame of mind.",
"There may be doubt about the outcome of a project that means a lot to you. It may involve financial problems or lack the support from others that you require in order to complete it. Your doubts are most likely groundless, Leo, but it doesn't hurt to hedge your bets a little and seek what you need elsewhere. This is likely to be a temporary delay. All signs indicate success.",
"You might be thrown off balance by the flightiness of today, Leo. Perhaps it's difficult to make a decision about anything. Try not to get too caught up in the gossip swarming around you. People may talk quite a bit today, but what you should be concerned with is substance. You want results and action, not empty information and promises.",
"Making use of state-of-the-art technology to increase your income could take up your time and energy today, Leo. You might be starting a new business or enhancing the efficiency of a current one, but in order to do it your brain will have to process a lot of information. Don't be intimidated by the technical stuff. Just take it step by step and you'll catch on.",
"You generally like to think of yourself as a practical and down-to-Earth person, Leo. Today you might depend on intuition more than usual. People around you might seem to be acting peculiarly, and your insight could give you hints as to their true motivations and how to deal with them. Relations with colleagues could especially benefit from this. Follow your heart!",
"If you've had some problems in your sentimental life during the last few months, Leo, they're probably behind you now. It's a sure bet that you've learned something. You've been served the same dish for years and now it seems you've finally had enough! Know that from now on you'll be better about not falling into the same old traps.",
"Your strong yet steady pace may get a lift today, Leo. It might seem like there's a fire under your feet, and you probably need to keep moving in order to keep yourself from getting burned. Use your independent streak to get things done the way you want them. This could be a powerhouse day for you!",
"Love and romance are key aspects of the day, Leo. You should find that things relating to these aspects of your life are going well. Your mind is much more penetrating than usual, and your search for deeper knowledge can be quenched with less effort than might usually be required. Your creative spirit is anxious to find an outlet for adventure.",
"New career opportunities appear on the scene to reawaken your ambition. You might come across some unusual possibilities for advancement that you've never considered before. This can be a bit intimidating but also exciting. You're unlikely to pass up any chances until you consider them. Success and good fortune are indicated.",
"Are you involved in an important group activity, possibly with close friends? If so, you might be working on a vital task, probably involving communication. A love partner might also be involved. You can be rather intense at times like this, so don't come on too strong with those around you. Use all your people skills, be a good listener, and you should accomplish what you want.",
"Have you been thinking about changing jobs or taking up a new profession? If you have, now's the time to lay the groundwork. If you haven't considered it, a new opportunity may take you by surprise. You may go from a behind-the-scenes career like banking to a very public profession like acting. Don't hesitate because of insecurity. If you like what's happening, go for it.",
"There are important lessons to learn today, so listen closely. You may have been thinking other people should grow up. Even if you haven't spoken those words to them directly, you've thought them to yourself. Understand now that perhaps you're the one who needs to do a little growing. Don't write people off so quickly. There's something important to learn from everyone.",
"Your strong business head and practical skills couple with imagination and innovation to bring advancement your way. Information received from far away could prove especially valuable now. Relationships with friends and neighbors should be warm, cordial, and cooperative. Love relationships also prove rewarding. This evening blow off a little steam by going out.",
"Do you want to surprise your partner with a gift? Perhaps there's something that your beloved has wanted for a long time but hasn't bought. This would make a wonderful surprise, and should be greatly appreciated. Expressions of gratitude could be followed by a long conversation that brings you closer together.",
"You may be asking, \"Why me?\" in almost every realm of your life today. For some reason it seems that everyone but you has exactly what they want. Perhaps you're just being too picky. Your standards are high, and this is fine. It's easy to reach small goals. You've picked the largest mountain to climb. Be patient.",
"You're in a sticky emotional battle in which someone is trying to twist your words to make you look like the bad guy. As soon as you try to get a project started, someone moves counter to your aims. Perhaps this is all due to a misunderstanding. Take the time to clear the air in all your relationships.",
"There's a spark about to ignite inside you. Pay close attention to your emotions and take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Infuse your plans with passion. Breathe life into your dreams and act with confidence. The inner and outer aspects of your being are working in harmony.",
"This could be a lucky day as far as money matters are concerned. Perhaps a sum you were expecting and gave up on will arrive unexpectedly, or a chance to earn some extra income could come up. There might be paperwork involved, and the circumstances may be unusual, but don't be intimidated. Think of this as the day you grabbed the gold ring!",
"Be more aware of your personal appearance and how you're perceived. Make sure that your attire is appropriate for the people you're with and the situation. Fashion is a consideration, so don't look like a slob. You may be urged into a fancy store today where you're talked into buying some new items to spruce up your wardrobe.",
"Intimate relationships gather steam as increased involvement in each other's life brings you closer. Relationships grow through enhanced communication and shared dreams, goals, and ideals - not to mention physical passion! You should feel strong and confident today, especially as your material success continues. Travel, a new car, and a few luxury items might be on your agenda.",
"Unexpected events may throw you for a loop today, but these incidents could be part of a bigger trend that you should pay attention to. There's great opportunity at hand, and you shouldn't ignore it. Small things may indicate some major change that needs to happen in your life before this new energy can take hold. Clear out the cobwebs and welcome a breath of fresh air.",
"Have you been concentrating strongly on spiritual studies for a while? Do you meditate regularly? If so, don't be surprised if insights and revelations come to mind today. Write them down. There will be too many to remember. If you're inclined toward writing, you might set your ideas down in a book, perhaps with publishing in mind. Doors open wide for you.",
"Responsibilities may be weighing on your mind today. Perhaps you've promised someone help but don't have the time and energy to come through right now. Don't be afraid to tell the person. Between the two of you, you can work something out that creates a win/win situation so your friend gets the needed help and you don't tire yourself out. A little ingenuity is all it takes!",
"You're likely feeling strong, healthy, and energetic. You might be inclined to take on huge tasks, some of which are more appropriate for three people than one. Be careful. You could take on more than you can handle. The strength and energy you feel now could wilt under too heavy a load. Pace yourself!",
"Are you planning to hear a sermon, lecture, or speech of some kind today? Don't be surprised if what the speaker says turns out to be more hot air than useful information. He or she is probably more interested in venting feelings than presenting the facts. Opinions can be valuable, too, so listen. Take it all with a grain of salt until you've checked out the facts.",
"You may be experiencing a wonderful openness to new ideas and grand plans. You're enjoying an active imagination and your intuition is sharp. Trust in your self-awareness and confidence. If a friend with a negative attitude tries to dissuade you from your plans, keep it in perspective. Consider the source. Stay in tune with your initiatives and you'll succeed.",
"You may be feeling nostalgic for old friends and faraway family. Even if you haven't spoken to them in a while, pick up the phone and call them up. All signs indicate that anyone you talk to today will be very glad to hear from you. You'll be surprised by how much you have in common. The conversation picks up right where you left off last time.",
"Today's energies will bring good fortune and success. New opportunities to increase status and income could come your way. You could make some new friends at the same time, including someone older than you who could be a potential love partner. This should prove to be a fortunate day for you, from friendship to romance to education to business.",
"You may feel frustration and loneliness today. All you want is to spend a quiet evening with your romantic partner, but you can't find him or her anywhere. Planes are late and rush-hour traffic is especially bad. Cell phones don't help. Your friend may as well be on the Moon. Take heart and know that you're missed just as much. When you do reconnect, the reunion will be electric!",
"Expect to hear from people you haven't heard from in some time. Make a cup of tea and savor every correspondence. You could feel nostalgic for the \"good old days\" when life seemed simpler and more of your friends were nearby. Pick up the phone and give one of them a call. Your old pal will be delighted to hear from you.",
"Expect a visitor to put you in touch with people who could make a real difference in your life. Changes are manifesting more quickly than you realize. Certainly all that's occurring is exciting, but the speed may have you feeling a little apprehensive. Fear often accompanies success. You can't move ahead without taking some risk. You're up to this challenge!",
"Don't blow things out of proportion today. You're apt to have a tendency to exaggerate everything to such a degree that you completely lose touch with the true reality of the situation. You could be painting a terrible scene in order to elicit pity from others. Be honest about the situation before you create more enemies than friends.",
"Being around others should be especially gratifying for you today. Most people should be friendly, and you'll enjoy their company. The downside is that your psychic faculties are acute, so you might pick up some unsettling feelings from those you talk to. You're likely to find that many smiles hide turmoil inside.",
"Try not to get too caught up in trying to penetrate to the core of everything today. Enjoy the simple pleasures that are free. Be entertained by a bug walking on your windowsill. See trees as art. See the shapes and colors around you. Don't view things as annoyances. Most of the time the things you shun are those that can teach you the most.",
"You may feel inspired to make certain changes in your home. Your imagination is especially acute, so it's easy to visualize how the rooms will look afterwards. You could seek others' opinions, too. Now you need to sell your family on the idea. Don't worry - you can do it. Your persuasive powers are at an all-time high.",
"A close friend or group with which you're associated could have money troubles. You might be asked to help, but be careful. It's doubtful that the person or organization will be able to pay you back. A goal that you've been working toward could get stalled, but this isn't the day to try to jump-start it. You may lack information. Take a day off and then fix it.",
"The special someone in your life might feel a little jealous of your friends now. Perhaps you've had a number of invitations that only involve you and your pals. It might be a good idea to turn down one in favor of being with your partner. Goals and projects may be blocked temporarily, which is frustrating. Let them ride for now.",
"Unexpected financial benefit could leave you speechless today. It could be an unanticipated bonus, gift, or even a small lottery win. This is the day to seek the improbable. If you have a project you've wanted to try but have hesitated because it's too risky, start it now. Success and good fortune should follow anything begun or completed now.",
"Tension may arise among friends when someone suddenly feels like an ignored third wheel. People tend to pair up. Do what you can to stay on topics to which everyone can contribute equally. Staying united is key. Together you're extremely powerful allies, while divided you're each other's worst enemies.",
"You may feel like you're doing all the work in a project or relationship and if you pull out for even a minute, the whole thing will fall apart. Be careful of putting so great a burden on yourself that you grow resentful of everyone else. You're good at criticizing other people's actions, but maybe the person you need to talk to about these issues is you.",
"The solar system is liable to trigger a transformation that will last several months. The change will center on the means you use to fulfill yourself in terms of your career and love life. If you feel hemmed in by your training or upbringing, you can expect to seek liberation from these inhibitions in the months to come.",
"If you've been reading about health and fitness and putting what you read into action, today you might suddenly feel the results of your efforts. You feel physically and mentally strong, healthy, and energetic. This could put you in just the right mood to give some extra attention to the matter. Take care not to obsess over it. You're doing fine.",
"Exploring your intellectual interests might get your curiosity going, although whatever knowledge you gain may bring up more questions than answers! You'll also want to get together with close friends or your partner to discuss this new information. You'll learn from them and they'll learn from you, so by the end of the day your head should be buzzing.",
"Today close friends, a love partner, or children may appear to be in a quiet, melancholy mood. You might wonder if you've done something to cause it, but it probably has very little to do with you, if anything. Responsibilities could be weighing on everyone, including you. The only answer is to pitch in and take care of business. Then treat yourselves afterward!",
"Today you may be powerfully attracted to someone from a distant state or foreign country. The person may be highly educated and stimulating. You could find the conversation riveting. This person could be involved in the sciences, psychology, or perhaps metaphysics. You'll probably choose to listen more than talk now.",
"Today, time will freeze and even seem to go backward. Use this pause to reflect on your motivations. The astral clues seem to suggest that you're currently settling questions that concern the fate of another person. Perhaps you should be spending an equal amount of time considering your fate as well.",
"Today you might feel a strong psychic link with a friend who lives far away that you haven't seen for a long time. You might wonder what this person is up to and this could be a bit worrying. Don't be shy. Call! One way or another, you should know what's happening. It could be that your friend is just having a bad day. Provide a sympathetic ear!",
"Take a break from what you're doing. Look at what people are doing around you. Check your plans in relation to those of others and see if there's a way you can combine forces and kill more birds with fewer stones. Cooperation instead of competition is the lesson that needs to be emphasized today. The better you learn this today, the better off you'll be tomorrow.",
"You might focus on romance today, but it's possible that you're having problems figuring out a way to express your feelings. There's power influencing the scene, and certainly no shortage of passion. You might find that there's a bit of superficiality to the situation that makes it hard to commit with all of your energy.",
"Try not to approach everything negatively. By doing so you may cut yourself off from incredible opportunities. This is a time to be expansive. Spread your wings and feel free to lift off the ground. Take greater pride in your work. You'll reach the goals that you strive for. Enjoy the path you're on. The journey is the reward.",
"Today you might enlist the aid of friends to increase your computer skills. You may be interested in the artistic side of computers and want to experiment with computer graphics or animation. Video journalism could also be of interest. You might receive some unexpected good news about a possible increase in income, though it might be delayed.",
"Money matters continue to go well, though you don't feel as secure about them as you should. A previously unsung talent, perhaps for the arts, healing, working with technology, or all three could come to light. You could look into ways to train it. You might want to explore different options. Your decision might surprise you.",
"You should feel emotionally stable today, but you may feel a bit unsure of yourself when it comes to data. Someone is challenging your way of thinking and demanding that you take a step farther out on the fragile limb. You're happy on the part of the branch that's much thicker and more stable. Feel free to stay there if you don't feel comfortable taking a chance now.",
"Today an organization dedicated to spiritual pursuits may open its doors in your neighborhood. This might be of special interest to you and your partner. You might want to go and check the place out. You could meet some interesting new people, hear about some fascinating ideas, and perhaps discover some new books. Be prepared for a fun evening.",
"You've almost reached an important finish line. Don't give up. This is the time to kick into high gear and get moving even more quickly than before. Your emotions may remain out in left field as they merge with your most active fantasies. Do your best to stay on track by looking forward instead of behind you. You can always change course after you reach this finish line.",
"All of a sudden you may experience a burst of emotional energy that throws a monkey wrench into your plans. Don't be surprised if you suddenly burst into tears over something that normally wouldn't even faze you. Sometimes it's important to let the emotions flow. Feel free to share your feelings. Don't try to hide them.",
"Reevaluate just what it is that you're working for. If it's fun and relaxation you're after, maybe you're passing it by without even realizing it. The fun you seek is there in front of you. It would be best if you took advantage of it now instead of waiting until some magic point at which you feel you've earned it.",
"Today you won't be indifferent to anything. Good news could elevate you to near ecstasy. Bad news could send you to the depths of despair. Visitors provide a welcome distraction, while spiritual pursuits may be your favorite topic of conversation. This isn't going to be a predictable day, but it will be wonderful.",
"An increase in your technical skills could bring you a new job or an increase in income. You may have felt a bit nervous and stressed lately, but this should balance out now. You feel focused and you're aiming carefully toward your goals. You'll succeed if you keep going as you are.",
"A loving, supportive letter or call from a close friend could be just what the doctor ordered today. You may feel overworked and a little pessimistic about any plans you've made. Your friend should lift your spirits and motivate you to push on ahead in spite of whatever obstacles you encounter. Remember this kindness. Your friend may need the same from you sometime in the future.",
"A letter or other communication serves as a sort of wake-up call today. A long-term goal is finally going to be reached. Your ambition should take on a new dimension, possibly going for a second career either in addition to or instead of the one you have. You might not be sure where you want to take it, but it's worth pursuing.",
"When it comes to topics of love and romance, your feelings continue to be intercepted by words and opinions from others. What you want to keep private is suddenly made more public by mouths that just don't stop talking. Relax into the sensual element of love instead of getting caught up in more political aspects of the situation.",
"An unexpected raise could have you feeling especially generous toward those you love. Your gifts will be appreciated, but take care that you don't wipe out all you've gained. Romantic ideals could permeate your consciousness, and you'll be thinking wonderful thoughts about a passionate encounter with your love partner. Go for it. Hang onto the memory in the days and weeks to come.",
"A specific task or goal could have you making a lot of calls, writing a lot of letters, or doing a lot of running around in the car. You're feeling especially determined. You'll succeed at this or anything else you try today. Conversations will be productive and could spur you on to new projects.",
"Finally, today, you'll know what it feels like to be in charge of things. You'll even feel that you were born to do it. In any case, you'll beautifully coordinate the day. You're the maestro conducting a full orchestra. You'll tell those around you what to do all day long. Isn't it fun to feel such personal power?",
"Do you often act as if the world is static and nothing ever changes? Sometimes you may think that humankind is a certain way, the world is a certain way, and so this is what you're going to do. Have you ever heard of evolution? The human race is constantly evolving, and so is the world. Look around!",
"Keep your wits about you today. You could be privy to some important information. You might get a good investment lead or a hot tip on the stock market. Even though it seems that your finances are about to take a marked upturn, don't plunge rashly into anything. Haste makes waste!",
"Disagreements and hot tempers could hinder the completion of an important project. There may be a detail to the plan that some people just can't agree on. It's best to attempt to rework it rather than try to bring everyone around to the current point of view. Everyone is too tense to listen to reason. Instead, hear what they have to say and act accordingly. Remain objective!",
"Today is a day to rest on your laurels, literally. You've achieved a tremendous amount in the last few days. You've earned some time off. Call in sick and go see a movie in the middle of the day. Take yourself out to lunch and order a glass of the best champagne. Take this day to reflect on your accomplishments before you set your mind on the next project.",
"Romantic matters should be going very well now, although today you might have some doubts. Your loved one may be quiet and preoccupied. Don't let your insecurities get the better of you! What's probably going on with your friend has little if anything to do with you and more to do with money matters. Your partner will tell you when the time is right.",
"It's likely that you've been working too hard and too long. Don't you think the time has come for a bit of a break? Even if you manage to drag yourself out of bed, you're unlikely to accomplish much. When your heart isn't in it, it's difficult for your mind to work. A few days of rest and relaxation will rejuvenate you. Perhaps you should take a short jaunt out of town.",
"There's something blossoming inside you today. The heavy pressure of the past several days has ebbed, and you're able to go about your business with a lighter heart. It would be a good idea to pay more attention to your body. Try to schedule more aerobic exercise and cut down on fats and sugars. Start some healthier habits.",
"Don't box yourself into a corner and shut out everything around you except your immediate concerns. The more you isolate yourself and insist that you don't need anyone else's help, the more frustrated and sad you'll become. If you're lonely, scared, or angry, admit this to yourself and others. Extend yourself outward instead of drawing further in.",
"If something is good, it's likely to feel like utopia. If something is bad, it's like the end of the world. There's no middle ground. This is a day of emotional extremes. You feel like you're giving it all or nothing. This is a climactic time for you. Work with the energy at hand rather than try to resist it. Tap into your emotions and use them to your advantage.",
"Minor family problems might make you gloomy today. Perhaps a family member is away, or there may have been some petty squabbles in your household. Others might want to invite friends over, but you may not feel all that sociable. Throw yourself into projects of your own. It could give you a feeling of accomplishment, defusing your downhearted mood and firing your enthusiasm. Try it!",
"New business contacts could bring the possibility of pursuing a new career in the psychic, spiritual, or healing arts, or perhaps in painting, writing, or another of the fine arts. Think seriously about it. Your own talent should be especially acute today. You could be thinking seriously about training to be more effective. The support of friends and groups could prove invaluable.",
"The result of a creative innovation you've been working on should make itself apparent today. You'll be pleasantly surprised! Your ingenuity should pay off big, and your accomplishments won't go unnoticed. You're likely to enjoy positive feedback, recognition, and bright prospects for the future development of your ideas. In the evening, go out and have a good time.",
"Make sure to take something to read with you. There may be times when you have to wait for someone and you'll want to be productive. You'll inevitably get antsy and could get angry with the person holding up your day. Having something to focus on will calm you and make you feel like you're not wasting your time. You could thoroughly enjoy the time rather than get angry.",
"The energy today means you'll feel on top of the world. Given your usual hardworking nature, you may need to keep an eye out for exhaustion. While the extra strength, health, and mental sharpness give you tremendous support to get a lot done, you have to know when to quit for the day, too. Save some of that energy for social or recreational activities.",
"You may feel you're coming to a dramatic emotional climax regarding an issue that you take personally. There's a strong force stirring up your feelings, but that doesn't mean you have to spin out of control. While this emotion builds within you, there's a solid, stable force helping you keep your feet on the ground. This lifeline is always there when you need it, so trust in it."]
