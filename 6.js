exports.arr = ["Join others for stimulating conversation and purposeful dreaming, Virgo. You aren't alone in your thoughts and strong opinions. Now is the time to be heard. Work toward maintaining peace by exposing truth. Take the time to create fantasy in your world by diluting the fears of reality. Make decisions based on love, cooperation, and prosperity instead of neediness, trepidation, and anger.",
"Tension may build today if you aren't careful about how you use your words, Virgo. Remember that forces are trying to push you one way and pull you another. You may encourage a focus on the collective while others seem too worried about themselves. Yet another force is calling for outdated remedies and traditional structures that no longer suit your purposes. Blaze your own trail.",
"Today's events may cause disruption in your routine, Virgo. Your emotions may seem clouded, and other people may challenge aspects of your ego. Relationships with the opposite sex may not be great today, so don't try to force an issue that you know will end up in conflict. There's an air of conservatism throughout the day that may not pair well with your unconventional nature. Lay low.",
"Don't sweat the small stuff, Virgo. You may feel like something is restricting your otherwise light, witty nature, but don't worry about it. Things probably seem worse than they really are. Trust in yourself. Relations with others may not be at their best, and it may seem like your feelings are being squeezed through the ringer. Keep your chin up and work to get things done right the first time.",
"Today may start out sluggish for you, Virgo, but by the end of the day the energy will move fast and furious. Your thoughts will be buzzing around your head like bees around a hive. An introspective and contemplative morning has filled your brain with a new wave of thoughts, which you will be eager to share with anything that has ears tonight.",
"You're always one to face things logically, Virgo, and today you turn that logic, along with your intuition, toward reassessing some of your values. Your judgment is especially acute, so any decisions you make or any new avenues you want to explore are likely to be just what you need now. Relations with friends, lovers, and family should be warm, loving, and close.",
"You may feel idealistic today, Virgo. This is fine, but make sure these ideals are rooted in reality or they may be nothing more than a pipe dream. Feel free to escape to another mindset, but make sure you can still discern what's real and what isn't. This is a formative time for you in which you realize that the conventional ways of doing things aren't working anymore. Spread the word.",
"Today your sensitivity joins forces with practicality. Intuitive insights could come to you today, and you might express your new ideas to others, Virgo. Don't be surprised if they accept them. Your unconscious mind is on a far more practical track than you may assume. Make use of this ability while you can because it might not be so clear tomorrow. Go with the flow.",
"Unexpected visitors might throw you into a dither. You could panic over how to dress, what to say, and what to serve. Don't make yourself crazy, Virgo. Follow your heart and go with the flow. Spontaneity is the best policy. Your guests will enjoy yourselves more if you worry less about being the perfect host. Just have fun.",
"Business transactions that could take place in your home or perhaps involve the home might seem a bit unclear today, Virgo. Before agreeing to anything, read the fine print and verify all the facts about what you're signing. Use your intuition. It's very high at this time. Family members might be confused about events in their lives, but they'll get over it.",
"Today you're apt to feel especially romantic. Novels, movies, and poetry about love will be appealing. If you're currently romantically involved, consider planning a special evening with your partner. If you aren't involved, you might want to attend a sporting event. Plan an enjoyable evening, Virgo. Who knows? You could meet someone new and exciting!",
"Discussions could bring some exciting information your way that alters your thinking slightly. You tend to be oriented toward social, political, or humanitarian issues, Virgo. Today you might have the chance to put your talents to work. Someone could ask you for assistance. You have the mental and physical energy to go for it, so it's likely that you will, though perhaps not right away.",
"Today you might concentrate on projects. These could be related to your personal relationships. Whatever the nature of your tasks, Virgo, don't be surprised if you find them confusing. You might be tempted to chuck it all and go out, but this isn't a good idea. Better to try to make sense of the confusion than put it off. It won't get any better with time.",
"Business transacted today either in your home or concerning your home is likely to be successful and bring some extra money your way. You probably feel especially optimistic about this. You're looking forward to new opportunities that may come your way. Your intuition is high, so you're likely to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff where opportunities are concerned. Go for it.",
"You might feel especially adventurous today, Virgo, and wish to go away for a while with a romantic partner. A spiritual retreat or a workshop in metaphysical disciplines might be an option to consider. This is a good time to go, especially if you're thinking about traveling by air. You should have a wonderful time. Let go of some misgivings, experience deep insights, and make new friends.",
"Friendships or love relationships formed today are rooted as much in intellectual compatibility as emotional attraction, Virgo. Stimulating conversations could take place with old and new friends alike. Creative projects go well. If you've been looking for some information, you should find it today. This should be a very busy, exciting day on a number of different levels.",
"Relatives or old friends, particularly seniors, who visit you today are likely to awaken childhood memories that you'd long since forgotten. Some of them might come as a shock, but they will all release hang-ups that you've been trying to expunge for a while. You might feel like you've just dropped a ton of weight - and you have. Psychological weight can be as heavy as anything physical.",
"An old friend you haven't seen for a while could suddenly reappear, and you might view this person in a different light as a potential business partner, source of inspiration, or even a romantic possibility. If this is your inclination, Virgo, don't write it off without giving it some careful consideration. Partnerships formed today are likely to lead to success.",
"It may feel like something has suddenly clicked into place for you today, Virgo, because you've found the missing piece of a puzzle you've been working on. The answers may be subtle, but they're there. Fantasy and a playful attitude will lead you to them effortlessly. Spread your ideas to the world, and encourage others to join in your daydreams.",
"Today you might be temporarily catapulted into the public eye when you'd rather be alone, Virgo. Perhaps a premonition you once expressed has actually come to pass and others want to discuss it. Maybe you will be asked to repeat a story you once told. Your friends will probably want you to entertain them. If you aren't in the mood for conversation, it's best to avoid social gatherings.",
"A surprising phone call or email could come your way today from a friend you haven't heard from in a long time, Virgo. This should make you happy, as you've probably been wondering what this person was doing. Some business changes may have occurred for your friend, but possible new opportunities might also be in the cards for you. Hear what your friend has to say, think about it, and decide later.",
"You may feel slightly bored and restless, Virgo. If so, an opportunity may come your way today that shouldn't be ignored. You may have a chance to take a trip to an exotic locale or attend a class or lecture that will open your mind to all sorts of interesting possibilities. Just because you only have one life, that doesn't mean you can't fit many different lives into it.",
"Keep your mind on the present, Virgo. As much as you'd like to be somewhere else, your daydreaming is getting out of hand. If you're sincere in your desire to explore other lands, begin some research. For now it's better to focus on any problems that make you want to run away. Open a dialogue with anyone with whom you've had a misunderstanding. You will find this brings immeasurable relief.",
"What's happening in your personal relationships, Virgo? It seems as though you're looking for a fight. Could it be that someone has stolen a leadership position out from under your nose? You have a tendency to lead any group, yet now you're confronted with resistance. You might want to get involved in a new group project. Doing so will help everyone reconcile.",
"A friend may be going through some pretty big changes, Virgo, and come to you for a sympathetic ear. The problem is that you might be a little stressed yourself and not feel much like hearing about someone else's troubles. Show some compassion. Try to listen for a little while. You might need a shoulder to cry on at some time in the future.",
"Wonderful news comes from far away, Virgo, possibly involving writing, teaching, or publishing. Creativity combines with heightened intellectual ability to bring success and good fortune to your door today. You might spend the day in a daze, waiting for it to sink in, and the evening celebrating with friends. This trend is likely to continue for the next few months. Make the most of it.",
"Some friends may put you in front of a lot of people, Virgo, perhaps to make an impromptu speech or lead a discussion. Generally, you don't mind this, but today you're in a quiet mood and would rather stay on the sidelines. You could grit your teeth and do what they ask. But don't be afraid to tell your friends how you feel. They don't really want to make you uncomfortable.",
"A group of friends may invite you to attend a festival or workshop involving the creative arts or metaphysical studies, or perhaps both, Virgo. You might resist at first, but once you get there you will find the subject and instructor captivating. Afterward, you won't want to talk about it. You will be too preoccupied with your thoughts. Write them down. You will want to remember them later.",
"Surprising developments in your life might bring a lot of visitors and much happiness to your home. You could host a party or other sort of gathering. This is likely to keep you very busy throughout the day, Virgo, but you will have fun all the same. Don't let shop talk interfere with times like this. This is the time to relax and enjoy your good fortune. Use it to your advantage.",
"You tend to be an adventurous soul by nature, Virgo. Today the desire to do something you've never done before could be overwhelming. You might toy with outrageous ideas like learning to skydive or bungee jump. You probably you won't go that far, but you could opt for something like river rafting or mountain climbing. You have a lot of options open to you. Think about them.",
"A goal you've recently been on the verge of attaining may suddenly hit unexpected setbacks, Virgo. However major or minor they are, it's going to be disheartening. The only thing you can do is pick up the pieces and move on. The goal isn't dead in the water. There are only some extra tasks that need to be done before you achieve it. Do what you have to, and hang in there.",
"Virgo, some volatile emotional matters that may have reared their heads over the past few days could finally be settled to the satisfaction of all involved. The subject of money may come up. Happiness reigns in the home, as all the members of your household are basically pleased with the way their lives are going. The appearance of some well-loved visitors may add to the contentment.",
"Do you have some paperwork regarding money that you've been putting off, Virgo? If so, this is a good day to get it out of the way once and for all. Your mind is especially sharp and your concentration strong, so you're less likely to be distracted or make mistakes. Take care of it first thing in the morning and then you can forget about it.",
"A friend might drop by and want you to keep them company while they runs errands, Virgo. This might be a good idea, not only for the diversion from routine but also because something might happen in the course of these short journeys that points you in a new and very positive direction. Your mind could suddenly be flooded with ideas. Make the most of it.",
"Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Virgo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.",
"An unexpected opportunity could temporarily throw your life into disorder, Virgo, but you will see from the start that this is a definite stroke of good luck that you shouldn't let pass. It could involve money, a chance to move to your dream home, or relationships in some way. Whatever it is, you're definitely going to be happy about it.",
"Your energy level should be high today, Virgo, so you're going to feel restless and spend most of your time out and about. There might be some chores you need to get done at home, but family members should help and you're apt to finish them all quickly. Paperwork might need to be completed, which could be the slowest of all your tasks. Don't get frustrated. Handle it and then have fun this evening.",
"Regardless of your gender, why not show a bit more virility in your relationships and actions? If you're dominated by your emotions, the day could be extremely trying for you. Protect yourself from your anxieties by talking things over with a friend or someone else close to you. This will help take some of the pressure off - that is, if that person knows how to be discreet.",
"Watch for any errors in orientation or strategic mistakes, Virgo. You may be having some communication problems with almost everyone today. You feel like whatever you say falls on deaf ears and that no one really wants to listen to you. Don't get frustrated. Relax and see it with humor. Just be an observer for one day and see what happens.",
"Life just seems to be smiling on you at the moment, Virgo. Some sort of mystical force has entered your life and is enriching your contact and with other people. It allows you to make a success of anything you undertake. Luck is really on your side, and you're on cloud nine. Have you made friends with the angels up there yet?",
"You tend to prefer intellectual and philosophical rather than practical pursuits, Virgo, but today you may feel especially practical and more inclined to want to get as many routine tasks out of the way as you can. This could involve chores around the house that you've neglected for a few days. Other members of your household could pitch in. Go to it. You will be glad you did.",
"A transformation in your circle of friends could occur today and change your life, Virgo. Someone exciting could move in nearby, and you could hit it off. Expect stimulating conversations and fascinating new information. If you aren't currently involved, this person could be a potential romance. At least you will make a new friend. Take a close look and don't initiate things too quickly.",
"Your inner strength and courage are tremendous today. You will find that people naturally gravitate toward you, Virgo. Accept this flood of energy and put it to good use however you see fit. A spark of genius may hit you sometime during the day. It will have you up all night working on a new invention.",
"Be careful of exerting your will too strongly toward someone who really isn't receptive to it, Virgo. Be conscious of other people's feelings. Be gentle when it comes to love and romance. You have a yellow light, which means that it's OK to proceed. Be careful that the other person is receptive to your advances. Don't come across as too aggressive and end up making a fool of yourself.",
"Have you been given a task to do at work that hasn't been explained properly, Virgo? If so, you may feel at a loss. What to do? It's best to go back to the person who assigned the work and ask for more details. This could be temporarily humbling, but remember, it's better to ask a stupid question than to make a stupid mistake. Don't move ahead until you know exactly what you need to do.",
"This is a fantastic day for you, Virgo. Join close friends and share a night on the town and fine meal. This is a chance to begin a new cycle of romance. Reflect on past relationship problems, examine their causes, and toss them away so you can invite in a new, uplifting energy for the next cycle of romance. Start a new relationship or strengthen the one you're in.",
"Today represents a new beginning in many ways. An old friend could reappear in your life and bring up memories that are both pleasant and disconcerting, Virgo. Don't worry too much about this. It probably represents a needed release. You may also get involved with a group that has goals you embrace. New friends could also come your way. Expect a few surprises from all sides today.",
"Some professional colleagues might be coming to visit, Virgo, and you may not be looking forward to it. You could be worried. How will it go? Will you make a good impression? Don't drive yourself crazy. It will be fine. Family members should be doing well regarding their responsibilities, although you might be a bit worried about them today. Relax. All is going to go very well.",
"Perhaps you planned to attend a group event but circumstances beyond your control got in the way. Maybe it was canceled. This could cause some disappointment for you and others, Virgo. Find something else to do. A project of your own is likely to need some attention, and this challenge could keep you engrossed for hours. Tonight, treat yourself to dinner out.",
"Today you may feel the need to do a lot of work around the house, Virgo. Perhaps you expect visitors or you simply want to get the place spruced up for your own enjoyment. You need to take it easy and not try to do everything at once. You could run into difficulties that require help from others who may be out. Pace yourself and control the urge to run through your chores like a steamroller.",
"There's a conservative air today that doesn't fit well with your erratic, unconventional nature, Virgo. Things might pop up to remind you that you should be a bit more disciplined in your approach. Your thoughts and emotions are perhaps a bit less controlled than usual, so take this time to become centered and evaluate the truth. Today is a good day to focus.",
"A love relationship that's been around for a long time could be enhanced today by an increased level of sensuality, Virgo. Intense emotion could pervade your being, making it difficult to concentrate on much else. You will probably spend the day looking forward to when you can be alone with your beloved. The passion that pervades your lovemaking now is worthy of a romance novel.",
"Your natural urge to innovate may seem to have vanished today, Virgo. You may not feel like doing anything outside of routine tasks that you can do automatically. You're suffering from low biorhythms, so don't fall into the trap of thinking you're turning into a lazy bum. Relax today, and tomorrow you will be your usual energetic, inventive self. Tonight, watch some videos and forget your day.",
"Don't be surprised if you're a little weepy today, Virgo. The influence from planets can enhance your sensitivity to almost everything, including your own feelings. Take heart. It's bound to be short-lived. Cry if you need to, since it can be cleansing. Try not to wallow too much. Chances are good that things will look better tomorrow. Take care of yourself today.",
"Consider putting your problem-solving skills to work today, Virgo. You have a real flair for investigating situations and figuring out what happened. If something comes your way that seems mysterious, take the bull by the horns and get to the truth. If you're baffled, use the process of elimination to narrow things down. Stick with it and you will learn what's what in no time.",
"No dream is too big or too late to fulfill. You may be thinking about your special dreams today, Virgo. Perhaps you aspire to do something really great, be a pioneer in some field, or be a prominent figure. Whatever it is can happen if you believe in yourself and work toward it. Don't let naysayers stop you. If you decide you can, you probably will.",
"Virgo, it's prime time to get busy. Activities that require focus or creativity will be supported. Physical strength and energy will encourage you to do something active. If you've felt sluggish, tired, or a little under the weather, today's planetary aspect can put an end to that. Consider artistic projects that take strength, such as building something out of wood.",
"Try to see nightmares as safe ways to understand feelings, Virgo. No one likes to experience them, and we'd sooner forget them once awake, but the best way to ensure they don't return is to understand them. What's frightening you? Why do you feel insecure? Consider these questions and look for answers. Fear, pain, and anxiety are the most common ingredients of a real cold-sweat nightmare.",
"The energy of the day makes you ready for almost anything, Virgo. Given your sometimes radical approach to whatever you do, you may need to rein yourself in. You also have a humanitarian approach to life. If the pursuit of your wants hurts others, it could create serious internal conflict. With this high energy, think your plans through before taking action to remain true to your values.",
"You may feel hemmed in by the role models society currently offers. As you struggle to reach your own definition of the truly innovative achiever, other people sometimes criticize your rather liberated attitude. Just because your ideas aren't in sync with theirs in no way invalidates them. If your ideas are too radical, theirs are too conventional. There's room for both viewpoints.",
"Invitations to some exciting social events in your neighborhood could come today, Virgo. You might hear from some friends who are planning to attend, so you could be enthusiastically looking forward to these events. You will enjoy getting together with your friends. Bear in mind that you could also meet new people who prove to be valuable business contacts. Make sure you look your best!",
"There may be important lessons about balance that come up today, Virgo. Make sure you're ready to handle the fire, because it will be coming at you. Egos are large, and everyone is going to have an opinion on everything. Tension may exist, but this doesn't mean you should back down from your position. Be flexible and understanding, but don't necessarily assume that you're wrong.",
"People may be wondering how to proceed while you're off doing your own thing. Don't go in one direction and leave someone else behind, Virgo. In matters regarding love and romance, you may have to slow down and communicate with your partner. Take the lead and try not to get slowed down by other people's indecisiveness. You know which direction to go, so go there.",
"A get-together with a current or potential romantic partner could lead to some stimulating discussions of concepts that interest you both, Virgo. You could make plans for future enterprises that bring you closer together. This is a good day to advance any relationships that involve mutual intellectual interests. Expect to spend much of your time in bookstores with your friend!",
"Romance should pick up speed today, Virgo. You could discover that you and a current or potential romantic partner have many spiritual interests in common. You might attend some lectures or workshops on one of these subjects together. Take care not to plan too much at once. One or both of you could run into conflicts and end up disappointing the other. Schedule a few and stick to your plans.",
"Travel by air seems possible today, Virgo. The appeal of foreign countries may be too strong to resist. If you don't have a passport, you'd better apply! Friends may be planning a trip abroad and invite you to accompany them. Your sense of adventure should ensure that you won't say no, but if you're tempted to for any reason, reconsider! Travel is important to you right now.",
"You may get out of bed with a jolt, Virgo, indicative of the fact that there are forces prodding you from almost every direction. It may seem like you're in high demand, so do your best to appease those who need your attention. The key for you is not to get overwhelmed to the point where you can no longer function at all. Go at your own pace and you will meet with tremendous success.",
"All the knowledge in the world will be no match for the emotional energy in the air on a day like today, Virgo. You may be carried away into a mystical realm where feelings take precedence over facts. Let go of reality for a while and free yourself from the hectic pace of everyday life. There's a strong pull toward the fantasy realm today, so feel free to go there.",
"Some equipment that you use a lot, perhaps an appliance, computer, or TV, might go on the blink today, Virgo. Don't try to fix it yourself even if you think you know how. Call a professional, and hang the expense. If you try to do it yourself, you might cause more damage to the equipment or perhaps to you! This is definitely a day to exercise caution. Be patient!",
"The desire to perform a service of some kind could attract you to group activities today, Virgo. You might attend a meeting of a group you aren't yet familiar with, and you could feel like a fifth wheel. Take heart! You will catch on soon, and the people in the group are likely to take to you. Your insights should prove valuable to them, and they will be quick to notice that!",
"There are many social demands on you now, Virgo, in addition to the usual demands of home and work. This is when you need to be selfish and guard your time. If you try and accommodate everyone else's wishes, you will sacrifice your own. To truly enjoy your time with others, remember that you must fulfill your own needs first.",
"Creative energies are flowing like a river today, Virgo. Ideas for projects should come thick and fast. You can't wait to get started. You may even formulate plans to market them once they're done. Love and romance should also be going well for you, as intellectual discussions could bring you and a current or potential love partner closer. Have a wonderful day and make the most of it!",
"A phone call could come from a friend bringing great news your way today, Virgo. This could involve the success of a project of some kind that you've both been involved with. The news should definitely be significant enough to merit a celebration. You and your friend could grab some others and go out on the town. Have a little fun! Tomorrow you can get started on the next project.",
"There is considerable grumpiness in the air today, Virgo. Everyone you know seems to be in a bad mood. However, you have the charm and persistence to pull them out from under that black cloud. Pay attention to any social invitations you receive, as you're likely to make some important professional contacts if you go.",
"A strange conversation could take place with someone you don't know well, Virgo. He or she could be an acquaintance from work or someone who's just arrived from far away. The talk could outline new career possibilities that you've never considered but find appealing. You might spend time thinking about it. This may be different, but these are strange times. If it feels right, look into it!",
"Some gossip about a friend who has recently begun a new relationship could reach you today, Virgo. This might come as a surprise, as you'd never have expected it of this person. You will be glad, because you want your friend to be happy. Don't be afraid to call and ask to hear all about it. It will be a pleasure for both of you!",
"Imagination and insights definitely advance a project today, Virgo. Discussions, perhaps involving money, spur you and your collaborators on to new innovative projects that might prove to be of great benefit to all. Don't let your inspiration stop there. Let the ideas and images spur you on toward new enterprises and horizons. Make the most of them in every possible way.",
"Anticipation is often as good as, if not better than, the actual event, Virgo. This is what you experience today as you and your partner plan an exciting getaway. It's a busy day, booking hotels and airline tickets, but it's fun, too. You and your mate are giddy with the excitement of it all. This is just what your relationship needs.",
"All isn't quiet at home today, Virgo. There's tension in the air. You can't shake the feeling that someone is lying. You're a peacemaker by nature, so your inclination is to suppress your suspicions. In this instance, your instincts are right. The person withholding information is doing it for your own good and will come to you once the situation has been resolved. You can all laugh about it then.",
"A fortunate change of circumstances in a friend's life could have a positive impact on your life, Virgo. This situation could involve a lot of adjustment, not to mention hard work. At times you may feel overwhelmed and somewhat intimidated by these developments. It's best to ignore these feelings and push on. Don't expect immediate results. They will come. Hang onto your optimism.",
"Group activities like rallies or festivals could take place in your neighborhood today. You may attend, Virgo, and you could learn some new concepts that give impetus to your spiritual growth. You may run into some old friends you haven't seen for a while. Talking with others could start your mind in a new direction. Take a walk before you go to bed tonight or you might not be able to sleep.",
"It may be that people are a bit upset by some of your recent actions or words, Virgo. The offhand remark you made a couple weeks ago is catching up to you. What you may consider friendly, lighthearted sparring may actual do a bit of damage to someone's sensitive emotions, especially today. Think before you speak. Others might not have as tough a skin as they seem to have.",
"Be a friend to someone new and lend a hand to a greater cause than just your own advancement, Virgo. Ally with people by offering your support instead of asking for it. Give more of yourself and you will find that in the long run you will receive a great deal more than you ever would have asked for. Be generous to the people around you and form collective goals that will benefit everyone.",
"Your life may seem to be at a crossroads, Virgo. A number of different possibilities could be opening up to you. The only thing that seems certain now is that changes are on the horizon. You will be facing some choices, but today isn't the day to consider them. Confusion reigns supreme. Be like Scarlet O'Hara and think about it tomorrow! You will be more focused and less doubtful by then.",
"Paperwork involving finances, Virgo, perhaps personal, perhaps involving your employer's funds, or both, is likely to need some intense attention during the day. This doesn't necessarily imply anything negative. In fact, just the opposite. It does mean that some careful planning or budgeting is going to be required in order to make the most of your current situation.",
"Today may be one of those days when you feel all dressed up with nowhere to go. Don't worry about the details, Virgo. Follow your heart to a fantasyland and join the outlandish and bizarre. The answer you seek is around the corner. You may sense that it's close but yet far. This is completely understandable. Take control of your destiny and work toward the goals that you've set.",
"When it comes to love and romance, you're probably on fire, Virgo. You have an incredible passion for love now, making you one of the most desirable catches around. Partner with someone who shares your thirst for adventure, spontaneity, and the bizarre. You need someone who can keep up with your erratic and powerful energy. If the person you're with doesn't fill the bill, look elsewhere.",
"Don't feel like you're obligated to jump through other people's hoops, Virgo. Just because someone wants you to do something doesn't mean you have to oblige. Bend over backward for yourself and not for the entertainment of others. Freedom is an operative word for you, so make sure you exercise this right in every aspect of your life. No one else is going to do it for you.",
"When you run errands today, check the bulletin boards in local businesses. You may have been longing for adventure and dreaming about getting away from it all, Virgo, but today you might find the excitement you crave right in your community. New events, people, and businesses that you will enjoy could be moving in. You might also discover a group that shares one of your interests.",
"You will get much farther than you think today, even with minimal effort, Virgo. There are plenty of avenues to take now, so even if one is jammed, there's always another that you can reach easily. Soon you will arrive at your destination with time to spare. The trick is to keep moving. Don't get stuck in one place with your engine running.",
"You may feel like you're on the run in some way or other today, Virgo. It may even seem like someone is chasing you. They're right on your heels and you're doing everything in your power to stay one step ahead. Have confidence in yourself. You will accomplish everything you need to do and still finish in front of the pack. There's a great deal of high energy coming your way.",
"Some strange phone calls might come your way, perhaps from people you don't know. Investments in real estate, particularly the home, should pay off now. You could also decide to make a new investment in this area. Follow your hunches, Virgo. Don't let your usual logic get in the way! Your mind is especially receptive to messages from other realms now. Make the most of it.",
"You may be faced with a difficult choice today in a particular area of your life, Virgo. It's likely the dilemma stems from a desire to follow your creative, imaginative spirit, while another part of you feels held down to things more practical and grounded. See what you can do to combine the two forces and fuse them into one powerful manifestation.",
"Just when you thought you had love and romance all worked out in your head, Virgo, something or someone steps in to put your heart in a whirl once again. More than likely, the intensely emotional drama of the day is a passing phase, so try not to get too worked up about it. Situations may seem life or death today, but remember that they aren't.",
"You're by nature a person who likes to look toward the future. Today is a very special day for you. You might wonder what the next few months hold, Virgo. You're trying to answer this question by looking within and coming up with insights about you and your goals that you've been too busy to see before. These will work for you and guide you in the right direction.",
"The energy you put out today will most definitely fuel the fire, Virgo, so make sure you have an extinguisher within reach. There's a spark of excitement in the air indicating that something new and different is coming around the bend. You may feel anxiety building up. Be patient and you will find that good things naturally come your way.",
"If you feel like you're running on reserve battery power, Virgo, remember that you always have a reserve tank ready to kick in. Don't disregard this. It might help you to know that there's only a little time left on the clock. You work more efficiently under pressure. Just remain calm and remember that it isn't the end of the world if things don't work out exactly the way you'd like.",
"When others can't seem to decide which way to proceed, it will become crucial that you stand up and be the deciding force, Virgo. Be as aggressive as you need to be today in order to set things in motion. The elements are already in place. What's needed now is a bit of follow-through. You're in the perfect position to provide this missing piece of the puzzle.",
"You usually like to think of yourself as being a scientific, logical person, Virgo, but today you may think more like a mystic. Your intuition is more active than usual, and you might come up with the same words as someone close to you. You might also feeling especially inspired to work in an innovative way. Use your intuition and go for it!",
"A new piece of equipment could be delivered to the workplace and make you feel like you've received a new toy. Resist the temptation to spend the afternoon playing! You should be feeling especially playful right now, Virgo, so this is a good time to organize or attend a sporting event. Unusual happenings throughout the day could make your head spin, so you will need some fun in the evening!",
"Your circle of friends is probably changing, Virgo, perhaps too rapidly for your tastes. Some friends may be moving away, or different interests have caused you to form new friendships. Your life seems to be going well right now, but you may miss your old friends and go through temporary fits of nostalgia. Focus on the future and move ahead!",
"A close friend or colleague could receive special recognition for good works today. You're pleased with your friend's success, Virgo, and grateful for your own good fortune. It seems that you also have achieved a long-term goal. While you may not be acknowledged in public like your friend, you know in your heart that you accomplished what you set out to. Your smile says it all.",
"Talk of traveling to distant and exotic places could come up at a gathering of family and friends, Virgo. Some of the talk is pure fantasy, but there are a few people among you who are genuinely serious about their plans. Are you considering going away for a while? If so, you might listen to what your friends have to say. It would certainly be fun if all of you went together!",
"With today's planetary energies, Virgo, you can expect a lot of contact with friends. In fact, just when you thought you'd never receive another invitation or attend another party, one comes your way. Even though you may feel partied out right now, resist the urge to decline. You're likely to meet a very interesting person at this next bash.",
"Sometimes you can be too passive and let others trample all over you. Your lack of ego is admirable, but only up to a point, Virgo. Why let others take credit for your ideas? There could be a situation where you feel compelled to speak up. Protect your rights and defend yourself against an unethical person intent on downplaying your contribution. Hold your ground and you will be vindicated.",
"You may want to take a day off from your obligations, Virgo, perhaps to take care of unfinished creative projects. Chances are this may not be possible. Concerns about work issues might keep your mind occupied and distract you from the task at hand. This and possible family disagreements may have you upset. Try to remain centered and focused despite it all. It's the only way to get anything done.",
"You may be privy to some information today that will ultimately result in financial gain, Virgo. You may get wind of a new company and be one of the first investors. Or perhaps what you hear gives you an idea for a new product that you bring to market yourself. The outlook for you is rosy indeed, although your success won't come without putting your own skills and talents to use!",
"Your intuition is operating at a very high level, Virgo, except where your family is concerned! No matter how hard you try, you can't seem to make sense of anything anyone says, let alone does. Don't make yourself crazy over it. Ask for explanations, then barring anything destructive or nasty, let them go their own way. Sometimes people just have to learn through their own experiences.",
"Too much good food, good wine, and good conversation, Virgo? Not that any of this is undesirable, but you may be suffering from overload right now. Maybe you'd better get some rest and give your brain some time to sort through all the information you've taken in. Now you're probably having difficulty processing it all. Don't worry. In the morning you will be able to remember anything important!",
"You may not realize the effect of your erratic behavior on other people, Virgo. They may try to understand your viewpoint, but at times it seems you're talking in riddles. Slow down and clarify your thoughts before you dictate orders to others. You have incredible power. Learn how to harness it and become a good leader so you can make the most effective use of the resources at hand.",
"Go weed the garden, Virgo. If you don't have a garden, start one. It's important for you to get into the Earth today, so roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Feeling a connection with the ground is an important step in manifesting your dreams. Buy some seeds, fertilizer, and a watering can. This is a great day to create a nurturing environment in which a seed can grow.",
"Things are starting to lighten up for you, Virgo, even though you may find your interactions quite heavy today. Don't run away from the feeling. More than likely it's a result of you or the other person consciously or unconsciously wanting to get closer and more intimate. Your sensitivity is heightened. Let yourself feel rather than think. It's a day for listening rather than talking.",
"Your quest for the new and unconventional, the latest gadgets, and the best technology may come into conflict with a sobering force today, Virgo. New ways of doing things may suddenly be challenged by a more traditional approach. Realize that the opposition's strength may also be its biggest downfall. It's time to do away with the old and bring in the new.",
"If you've been thinking about investing, Virgo, this isn't the day to commit to anything. This is a great day to consider your options, study economic trends, and analyze what you want from investing. It isn't a good day to hand over the money. Land could be a strong possibility. Consult with professionals, read the papers, and look into all kinds of opportunities before committing to one.",
"You may have recently modified the material aspects of your life. Was it sufficient to stop there? More profound changes might be in order. Take a look at what motivated you to create the life you live now. Pay special attention to the choices you've made in your professional life. Are you sure you're doing what you were meant to do? Are your talents being used to their fullest?",
"Today isn't a good day to sign contracts or make any substantial purchases. Go to the grocery store, by all means, but buy hamburger not tenderloin. Keep your money in a safe place and save your reserves. Don't negotiate anything today, Virgo. No matter how good the offer sounds or how compelling the deal, just walk away.",
"A new and exciting person, possibly someone from a distant state or foreign country, could come into your life today. You could spend hours talking. The conversation could make you aware of new fields of interest that you find fascinating. Whether or not you pursue this attraction depends on your situation, but at the very least you will enjoy yourself!",
"A social event that involves the discussion of intellectual topics could occur today, Virgo. You could decide to go with a love partner. You're likely to enjoy the gathering so much that you may stay late into the night and then spend another hour or so discussing it with your partner. Afterward, anything could happen! In the future you will remember tonight as magical. Make the most of it!",
"A project of some kind you've been working on could be going well, Virgo, but today you might experience a sudden rush of inspiration that makes it a lot better than you originally envisioned. This could involve effort that seems intimidating at first, but the results should be worth it. Summon all your energy and determination and get to it. You will be very glad you did!",
"Love and romance are in the air, Virgo. The flame is going to be turned up a bit in an existing relationship. Perhaps you and your partner have been in a rut lately. Today you may see your friend in a new light. Your sweetie may do something unexpected like send you flowers or romantic email messages that open your eyes to who this person really is. You remember again why you fell in love.",
"Today you feel a tug of war between desires and obligations, Virgo. If you're smart about managing time, maybe you can satisfy both. You could be discouraged by how hard you've been working for minimal results. Take heart. You're accomplishing more than you realize. Your strong work ethic is what keeps you from having fun. Everyone needs some downtime. Work hard and then indulge your need to play.",
"Emotional turmoil may overwhelm your usual objectivity and good sense today, Virgo. Family problems could weigh on your mind, as communication between you and family members may be lacking. You might not feel in touch with what's going on. Try to encourage them to talk to you. If they won't, move on. Sometimes people want to deal with their troubles on their own. It's their choice.",
"It's time to take charge of your life, Virgo. Don't rely on other people to sort out your problems. There may some anxiety in the air today that causes you to overreact to a situation that normally wouldn't faze you. You need to dig down and take responsibility for getting out of this mental or emotional jam. Don't rely on other people to do it for you.",
"Have you been exercising too rigorously lately, Virgo? If so, you might feel some little aches and pains. Stay off your feet for most of the day. When you exercise, concentrate on stretching. Spend some time soaking in a hot tub if you can. The old saying, \"No pain, no gain\" has pretty much been discredited! Yoga or tai chi could serve you as well as aerobics today. Stick with those!",
"You might be in the midst of an exciting creative project with a partner, Virgo, and anxious to move forward so that you can present it to the public. But you might feel distracted and unable to focus on your work. Don't get too upset. These things happen. Be patient and wait until tomorrow if you have to. You will be back in the groove by then.",
"A goal you've been pursuing may be unworkable now, Virgo. You may have to put it on hold for a while. This could be disappointing, but think about it carefully. What other dreams do you have? Figure out which ones are most important to you and then decide which are most promising right now. Sometimes little setbacks like this prove to be blessings in disguise.",
"You're likely feeling a desire to do something different and a little crazy. Today you may fulfill that desire by attending a group event, perhaps a concert. Or you could indulge a childhood fantasy and go to the circus. Whatever you do, take along the special someone in your life. The fun you're bound to have will be so much sweeter when shared with a loved one.",
"If you have no significant other, Virgo, all indications are that this will soon change. A friend may set you up on a blind date that turns out to be a real winner. Perhaps you suddenly look at a long-time friend with new eyes. If you're in a committed relationship, you can expect to renew your bond. You feel closer to each other than ever. Celebrate your good fortune in finding each other.",
"Look to older figures for advice today, Virgo. Seek counsel with a parent or grandparent on issues you feel strongly about. Relationships with older people are likely to go especially well, and you will find you can break through barriers that may have existed between you and a certain member of your family. Make a conscious effort to patch any rifts among your closest kin.",
"Today you may need to be more selfless, Virgo. You may moan about the obligations and expectations placed on you, but you do what's expected. Much to your surprise, you actually find that you get more out of the experience than you put into it. You may visit a nursing home and be charmed by stories of the war years. Keep your mind and heart open. You will be richly rewarded.",
"Were you planning to go shopping today, Virgo? If you can, put it off until tomorrow. You could be tempted by too many items that seem wonderful in the store but are nothing but a bother once you get them home. If you must go, make the effort to bypass shops where you might fall into this trap. You don't want to have to make a second trip to bring back returns.",
"You hardly even believe in love, much less love at first sight, Virgo, but something that occurs today may turn you into a believer. You never know when it will happen. You could be in line at the grocery store when someone catches your eye (and heart). Perhaps someone with whom you've only had a phone relationship suddenly shows up at your office. Adventure lies ahead.",
"You're ready for a career change, Virgo, or at least a change of venue. Have you considered telecommuting one day per week? That might give you the variety you seek without needing to find a new job. You may meet someone today or in the near future who will have a dramatic influence on your career decisions. Listen carefully.",
"You probably aren't worried about being conventional in your relationships, Virgo. In fact, conventionality is often what causes you problems. If you're wondering what morality is and what it's based on, this is a good day to think about these questions.",
"Do you have a tendency to give more weight to popular opinion than your own feelings, Virgo? Maybe you only want to see movies that everyone talks about, listen to the popular music, or read best sellers. In short, your tastes are exactly like most of America's. Is this what you want? Even when you don't like a movie, you may say you do if everyone else does. Listen to your ideas today.",
"Some friends associated with a group you admire might take you to some kind of rally, Virgo. This could be a lot of fun for you. You could make some new friends. You're naturally inclined toward humanitarian concerns, and these might be the focus of some animated discussions today. Take in all the information and consider it later. Right now your mind is overwhelmed!",
"Today it might be more difficult than usual for you to deal with words, Virgo. Someone might lend you a book on a rather obscure subject that you can't understand. In fact, you might find the book - or anything else you try to read - boring! You don't want to hurt your friend's feelings. Put the book aside and try again later. The words should be clearer to you then.",
"Virgo, if you're waiting for someone to fulfill all of your needs, you may have to wait a very long time. The paradox of love is that it arrives on your doorstep in its most profound form when you need it least. So take whatever steps you must in order to fulfill yourself. If you don't, you will be eternally dependent, which doesn't suit you very well.",
"Sometimes you have to go back to square one if you want a situation to get better, Virgo. This can be frustrating or even humiliating, but if the goal is to have a solid foundation on which to rebuild, it's well worth it! Don't get too attached to your professional past. You have to advance and you're too weighed down now. Let go!",
"You can look forward to a day full of satisfaction, Virgo. You may have made a strong impression on the people around you as you learned to moderate your outspokenness. Supportive friends surround you today. Everyone seems willing to listen, and they trust you implicitly. It looks as though you're finding a place for yourself!",
"Virgo, you should try to be tolerant of other people's social and political positions. You may have to deal with certain people whose personal plans are jeopardized by events beyond their control. Don't judge them. Don't immediately defend one viewpoint without thinking how the situation affects the other person's life.",
"You won't be able to fix your indecisiveness, Virgo. You just need to give yourself some time. The direction your life is taking isn't clear at the moment. There are great changes going on inside you. So, even though it may sound like strange advice, don't do a thing about it! Let the situation get clearer before you act.",
"Your mother and father, or a couple you're particularly close to, could visit you today, Virgo. Plan some distractions like movies or videos, or invite some other people over. Talking with this couple alone might result in heated discussions that accomplish nothing but get everyone worked up and stressed. Whatever happens, don't let it get you down. Everyone should feel better tomorrow.",
"Today your mind is likely to be on travel, Virgo. You might have to spend a lot of time running errands in the car. You could also be planning a long vacation, perhaps one centered on a group function or seminar of some sort. Your physical energy is high, but there's still a danger of tiring yourself out. Relax at home this evening.",
"Your mind is especially acute today, Virgo. You may come up with ideas for new projects. You're feeling especially motivated and courageous. Don't be surprised if you try to achieve the impossible. Friends or groups could play a strong role in whatever you try. Move ahead cautiously, but move ahead. Don't let the day's advantages pass you by.",
"Most of the time you deal with the facts, Virgo. Facts are things you can grasp, categorize, and make rational sense of. Unfortunately, today some of your facts may be challenged by one of the things you fear most - intense emotions. The ensuing friction is like dealing with apples and oranges. You may find it hard to find any common ground from which to negotiate.",
"Be flexible in your communication, Virgo, and doors will open to you that you didn't even know were there. There's a tremendous amount of physical energy at your disposal. Don't waste it. By being rigid about your ways and insisting on doing things only according to your philosophy, you deprive yourself of the spontaneous adventures that give life the spice and variety you love.",
"This is a climactic time for you, Virgo. You may feel like many difficult issues are coming to a head. You may lash out and snap at people who don't deserve it. Your actions may make the issue even more difficult to deal with. The key today is to bring more balance into your life. By controlling and stabilizing your feelings, you can deal with the difficult issues that arise.",
"News of unforeseen success could come your way today, leaving you reeling and breathless. You might feel a bit dazed, Virgo, like you don't know what to do with yourself. It might take a while to gather yourself. A lot of letters and phone calls may come your way, some routine, some congratulatory. You could write or call a number of your friends. Some errands may be necessary.",
"There's no doubt that today will be excellent, Virgo. You can find satisfaction that puts a smile on your face and boosts your morale. There's the likelihood that you're challenging some of your core values. While it's true that these values have stabilized your life, you may be starting to feel they're less relevant. Approval from loved ones gives you the assurance that anything is possible.",
"You may have planned to isolate yourself in order to get things done, but that won't be possible. It's like a force is destabilizing your professional life. Nothing seems to go right today. Everyone may be disagreeing, misunderstandings may crop up, things could be delayed, and communications are likely to be scrambled. You will be asked to take sides in a conflict, Virgo. Try to stay neutral.",
"Communication with friends or family may not come easily today, Virgo. An unusual level of inhibition could keep you from reaching out to others. You might try to shake this off by working too hard, even if you aren't sure exactly what you want to do. This is a good day to read, study, or work on projects in solitude. A long walk during the day could clear your head and reignite your enthusiasm.",
"You will have to expect the day to be somewhat frustrating, Virgo. Your friends may insist that you be more cooperative and less individualistic. They could resent your refusal to be part of the team. In fact, your rebelliousness may be earning you quite a reputation! How you deal with these clashes will set the stage for your future. Think carefully before taking action.",
"You may have noticed for some time now to what an extent your ambitions wear you out and to what point they have become outdated. If you aspire to live an ambitious life, but also one that is calmer and more balanced, the celestial energy is indicating the moment has come to make some important decisions, Virgo.",
"Will there be change in you during the next few weeks, Virgo? This is always the question that one asks with this changing planetary environment. It's appealing to think that you may be traveling to exotic locations or perhaps changing jobs and meeting some interesting new people. Anything is possible with these aspects. Enjoy the renewed atmosphere!",
"Today may start out frustrating, Virgo. Be prepared! Some equipment might go on the blink and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from your partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This would not only provide an energy outlet but also clear your head.",
"A previously untapped talent could emerge today, Virgo. You may decide to train this talent and foster a skill that can help you with any type of work you will do. This is definitely the day for it, as you should be full of energy and enthusiasm, capable of assuming any task, however formidable. Physically, you should feel strong and well. This is a day full of challenges and new enterprises.",
"You may be seduced by fantastic promises that offer wonderful rewards. Beware of lots of bells and whistles, Virgo. There may be a great deal of talk but not much to substantiate such wonderful claims. Don't be surprised if people with intense emotions are stepping up to add their opinions about how you should run your life. Don't forget who's boss.",
"You may find today a bit upsetting, Virgo. Your nurturing instincts genuinely want to assist the many people who ask for your help and advice, yet you can't shake the feeling that they're taking advantage of you or trying to make you do things you don't want to do. Yes, it's hard to be a good parent to others and yourself at the same time.",
"Be careful about being driven so strongly that you fail to take into consideration the changing environment, Virgo. Things have probably changed quite a bit since you first set out on this mission. You may have packed for sunshine and suddenly it looks like rain. Put away your sunglasses and take out your umbrella. It's important that you adapt to unexpected change.",
"There may be tension in your heart today that could be difficult to shake, Virgo. You might find it hard to relate to people or that others aren't hearing you very well. Keep in mind that you may have to translate your thoughts in order to get your message across. Keep an open mind as you deal with others on a one-to-one basis.",
"This planetary energy is going to test your recurring desire to go to the other side of the world or have a ready exit in any relationship. You do this so you won't feel trapped and, above all, so you won't be dependent. This is one of your strengths, Virgo, but it's also one of your weaknesses. Throughout the next few weeks you will be pushed to involve yourself more intimately with others.",
"Freedom may be a theme for you today, Virgo. You're beginning to question what it is you're trying to free yourself from. A person? Job? Commitment? These may be the very things you start to search for as soon as you're free of them. Trying to figure out what you want and need in life is sometimes easier said than done. Don't get stuck on one concept. Do your best to take things gradually.",
"Spread goodwill and affection today, Virgo. It's been a while since you let people know that you care about and appreciate them. Cards, phone calls, letters, flowers, and hugs are ways to express your feelings. Consider surprising someone with lunch, or making something special for a friend. Make time for emotional as well as intellectual expression. It keeps a healthy balance in your life.",
"Your enthusiasm is contagious, Virgo, and you should do what you can to share this feeling with others. In matters of the heart, have confidence that you know exactly where you stand. You also have the map of the surrounding area and beyond. You have the ability to get to any place you want to go. Accept the power that comes from strong connections in you and with people around you.",
"Today isn't a good day to sign contracts or make any substantial purchases, Virgo. Go to the grocery store, by all means, but buy hamburger, not tenderloin. Keep your money at home and safeguard your reserves. Don't negotiate about anything. No matter how good the offer sounds or how compelling the deal, walk away.",
"You may have your head in the clouds today, Virgo. At the same time, there's a need for you to keep your feet on the ground. This contradiction of energies might make it difficult to find peace, but you should find comfort knowing that this will soon end. Deal with conflicting issues the best you can. They will help you find the balance and perspective you need.",
"The cosmos will ask you to make more of an effort, Virgo. To do so means you will have to come back down to Earth and join the rest of us mere mortals. You may be cultivating your independence a bit too much. You seem to be pulling away from people. You should try to mix more and get involved in a cause that's bigger than you. Accept working with others as a necessary component of your life.",
"This may feel like a day made just for you, Virgo. You're emotionally strong. You feel like you're able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Tackle all those projects you love but have been too scared to start. You have a great deal of energy and confidence in your favor. You will succeed in almost anything you try, so don't waste this moment by just watching TV.",
"The pace will be jumping today and your wit and cheerful words will be welcomed in almost every setting you enter, Virgo. Do things with others and see what kind of \"trouble\" you can stir up together. This is a time to get out and be social. Beautiful things and relaxing music are all favored on a day like this. You can do no wrong by just being your usual, outlandish self!",
"Strong forces may act up today and ask you to stand up a little straighter than usual, Virgo. Keep your shoulders back and be proud. Don't think any less of yourself just because there is disagreement between you and others. Maintain respect for your opinions. Say things with confidence and don't back down, but be prepared to defend your views.",
"Spend time with good friends today, Virgo. Share dinner with people you love and feel free to be generous with the food and drink. You have the ability to control just about every situation. Remind others that they're part of a greater whole and that working together is the key to accomplishing great feats. Inspire others to be the best they can be.",
"There may be a battle between old and new in your world today, Virgo. A reserved and old-fashioned perspective has a strong hold on the prevailing sentiment. This feeling is likely going to hit you square in the face as you lean toward the unconventional and more revolutionary approach to life. See what sort of past lessons you can learn from as you build the future.",
"Get your favorite music out of the closet today, Virgo. Have a dance party in your living room and liven things up with some freshly cut flowers on your table. This is a great day to direct your energies outward into the world. Go on a radical adventure that you didn't think was possible. Plow headfirst into new projects and let your good luck carry you through. Don't worry about the details.",
"This is one of those days in which you need to act or else you will be acted upon, Virgo. Stubborn, aggressive forces are working counter to your aims. You will find yourself swept up in the thick of things if you aren't careful. Don't get too worried about what other people consider wrong. Have confidence in what you know is right.",
"Many people spend their whole adult lives trying to discover their true self, Virgo. A great deal of social conditioning by parents and our environment plays a role in shaping our minds. Realize that many of these influences don't necessarily ring true with your inner self. Take this day to uncover some of those early influences and discard the ones that don't belong to you.",
"Don't get sad if no one is laughing at your jokes today, Virgo. It doesn't mean you aren't funny. It just means that people may not be in the mood to laugh. Ridiculous as it seems, today is simply a better day to cry. Let out all your pent-up emotions. Talk things over with others. Your heart communicates well through you today.",
"Today is an excellent day for you, Virgo. Events will flow quite smoothly. The only thing to be aware of is that your emotions may seem rather erratic and unwieldy. There's a great deal of power behind your words and people are sure to listen. They would be smart to do so. What you have to say will be right on target with today's energy.",
"You will be able to think clearly today, Virgo. Do the best you can with what you have to work with. Do your thing and let people do theirs. Don't dwell on others' dramas. You should enjoy a good working relationship with mechanical objects, and it's a great time to invest in a new gadget or appliance for your home. Don't be a cheapskate. Spend to make life easier.",
"Be a pioneer in your world today, Virgo. Go on an adventure with a courageous spirit. Your emotions are fired up and ready to go. Your instincts are ready for a new challenge. If anything slows you down today, it will be your rational thinking. Your self-protection mechanism may kick in just when things start to get exciting. Strike the right balance.",
"Your expansive nature is reaching out to others, Virgo, but you may run into opposition. Keep in mind that not everyone wants your advice. Give it only if someone asks for it. It may be in your nature to want to jump into people's lives and fix things. Resist that temptation. What people may need instead is someone to listen.",
"You're attracted to eccentric individuals with very strong personalities. But realize that behind this attraction lies a very strong need for freedom, Virgo. In your life, freedom is more fantasy than reality. The time has come for you to do some soul searching. Try not to hide from the realities of your life.",
"Today you may have a difference of opinion with a relative. You will try to resolve this problem. You will be irritated by this present situation, and almost feel that your relationship has been altered for good. There is probably just a lack of communication between you. You have to try to work things out together.",
"You may feel your life is full of uninteresting people. You think they're all alike and fit perfectly within a conservative society. You don't want to be like them and would prefer to meet unusual individuals, people who differ from the crowd. They aren't too far away. You just need to make an effort to look for them.",
"Today may be quite emotionally intense, Virgo. Your greatest gifts may get you into trouble on a day like this, but that doesn't mean you should stop being yourself for even one minute. There's a great deal of important information to exchange, so remain open to all opportunities and possibilities. Meet the world with open arms.",
"Don't say anything about someone behind his or her back that you wouldn't want to say if the person were standing right next to you, Virgo. Feelings are easily hurt on a day like this. People will instinctively know that you've been saying negative things about them. Come clean with any confessions that you might need to make toward someone you love. Be honest and open with your feelings.",
"There may be tremendous changes in store for you, Virgo. Connect with something futuristic and far out. There may be some roadblocks in the way. Maybe your heart is impeding your progress. You don't need another person to fill in any voids in your life. Your confidence is what you need to bolster your self-esteem.",
"Things might reach a climax in some way today, Virgo. Set aside time to think about what you can do to love yourself. Maybe you've been thinking so much about group needs that you've failed to think about how to take care of yourself. Preaching your ideas and values to others means nothing unless you apply them to yourself.",
"Go for the gold, Virgo. Don't settle for less. There's an expansive energy on your side urging you on to prosperity in every aspect of your life. Take control of the situation and act on your emotions. Don't refrain from doing something because you think it's going to hurt someone's feelings. Other people can take care of themselves. You're responsible for you. Do what's best for your well-being.",
"Today's powerful astral phenomena will encourage you to develop your skill as a visionary, Virgo, no matter what you do with your day. You're one of those rare people who can sense before anyone else the changes that will happen in the world. Let these feelings encourage you. Use them to believe in tomorrow.",
"Secrets that someone close has been trying to keep hidden could come out today, Virgo. This may or may not be something Earthshaking, but either way, some quick damage control might prevent them from becoming common knowledge. The people around you are more understanding than you know, so express how you feel. By tomorrow it should be old news. Take care of business and all will be well.",
"A check you may have been expecting in the mail may be delayed, Virgo, and you might not be able to contact whoever is sending it. You could worry over whether or not you will get it at all. This could be a classic case of getting worked up over nothing. The delay won't cause any lasting problems, just inconvenience and frustration. Hang in there. The money will come.",
"Strong intuitive rapport with someone who lives far away could create a desire to contact this person. This is a good idea, Virgo, as this person may be going through a positive transition in life and eager to share the news. This communication could bring you closer together, so go for it. Whatever is happening with your friend could spill over into your life in some way.",
"Today it may seem like home and family responsibilities are interfering with your social life, Virgo, including a get-together you really want to attend. Don't worry. All signs are that something unexpected will occur at the last minute that makes it possible for you to proceed with your plans. Try to take care of your duties as efficiently as you can so you can enjoy the evening.",
"You could be on a real emotional high today because of your success and that of other household members, Virgo. Your mind may be buzzing with ideas for future expansion, some of which may not be all that workable. However, you should allow yourself a few flights of fancy. Tomorrow your feet will be back on the ground and you will see things in a more practical light.",
"You might host a social event in your home tonight, Virgo. You may be nervous at first, wondering if all will go well. Your efforts should produce the results you want. You might be introduced to new contacts, which could lead to increased professional opportunities. Take a walk after everyone has gone. Your mind will be going a thousand miles an hour and you will want to clear your head.",
"Confusion over money matters might arise, Virgo. You may need to check your records to shed light on past transactions. Don't worry. All should be well once you ascertain the facts. You might have some intense dreams tonight. Write them down. You will want to remember them later, because they might reveal a lot about your current situation. They may also inspire future projects.",
"This may be one of those days when you don't know which way to turn. For some reason, you just can't make a decision, so you keep going around and around. Stop and rest. Get out and walk for a while until your head stops spinning. Wait until your mind clears before you make your next major move.",
"Heightened intuition could lead to some interesting conversations, Virgo. Others could be blown away by your insights into their thoughts, feelings, and desires. You could also feel more expressive than usual. You might want to channel some of that inspiration into writing, speaking, or some other form of self-expression. Reading could prove especially valuable at this time.",
"Say what's on your mind, Virgo, but don't take offense if no one seems to listen. Don't bulldoze your point through. Whiners aren't popular, either. Concentrate instead on your aspirations and push yourself to the limit. You might have been talking a lot lately, and getting those ideas out there is great. Now is the time when you need to lay some groundwork in order to realize those ideas.",
"Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Virgo, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.",
"An emotional issue could be rubbing you the wrong way, Virgo. Your impulse is to escape. Try to do so in a healthy manner. Go see a movie or read a book. Don't fall prey to the temptation to indulge in alcohol or food. This will only push the problems away temporarily. When they resurface again, they may be even harder to handle.",
"Pay attention to the news today, Virgo, and not just the mainstream news but the offbeat, smaller publications, too. Question what you hear and read. Take an active role to increase your knowledge of the world. Take responsibility for your citizenship by keeping an eye on what's going on. Information is an important part of gaining power.",
"This is an excellent day for you, Virgo. Celebrate. Your ego is strong. Beautiful things are flowing your way. You should enjoy a good mood that will attract favorable people and situations to you. There's virtually no limit to the expansiveness of this day. One thing to watch out for is arrogance. Be proud but not obnoxious.",
"Stop hiding behind your intellectual barrier, Virgo. Playing games will get you nowhere. True strength is standing up and demonstrating that you can say what you feel in any situation, especially regarding a close loved one. If you feel the need to say something, say it. Don't wait until the situation escalates to an unhealthy argument before you finally get your feelings out.",
"If people start to hassle you today or give you a hard time about your appearance, pay them no mind, Virgo. You have the right to live your life any way you want. If that means you want to go around the house in a grubby shirt and sweatpants that haven't been washed in months, so be it. Be the person you want to be.",
"Get up early and get working, Virgo. You have a lot of emotional and physical energy that should help you accomplish whatever you need to do. The planetary energy is on your side. Take advantage of it to say what's on your mind and get a step closer to wherever you need to be. Your active, receptive nature is prominent. You should be able to find a healthy balance between giving and receiving.",
"It's important to take action on a day like this, Virgo. Trust yourself and your instincts. Often you have the perfect counsel for everyone but you. Keep in mind that you might have to turn to others for the best advice for you. Talk things out and then take action. Hesitation will only have negative consequences. You have all the facts you need.",
"Find comfort in your work today, Virgo. Although it may sound ridiculous, checking things off your list is the most rewarding activity today. Try not to be too critical of others. Focus on your tasks. Mountains that seem too daunting to climb will continue to grow bigger until you take the first step upward. Your perseverance will inspire others.",
"You might find that others have a \"me first\" attitude that doesn't sit quite right with you, Virgo. You may need to wake them up and say, \"Hey, what about everybody else?\" Try not to whine as you deliver this message. Desperation or complaining will get you nowhere. Be friendly and jovial in your approach and you will have the world at your feet.",
"You're a kind, caring individual, Virgo. Today your concern for others may be so strong that you take steps to do something concrete to save, if not the world, at least a few of the individuals in it. You may hear of a worthy cause that's about to fold for lack of volunteers. You could turn out to be just the savior they need. One person truly can make a difference. You can prove it today.",
"Today is one of those days in which prosperity is much closer than you think, Virgo. You may know what you seek, but it's up to you to take the first step toward going after it. You're probably looking for solid answers to your deep, probing questions. Don't let your inquisitive mind rest until you find answers that ring true for you.",
"Today is one of those days in which you have a terrific opportunity to break free of normal, everyday life, Virgo. Don't feel badly if you don't know exactly which way to go. Follow your gut feeling. Whichever way you decide to go will probably be right. Your forceful, erratic approach may actually be the perfect method to use in order to get exactly where you need to be.",
"Your opinions might be the focus of conversation all day, Virgo. You have a very strong will that you aren't afraid to express. You will get that chance. Enlighten others with your wealth of knowledge. Take control of the conversation and accept the mental challenge of trying to win other people over to your side. Whether you're successful or not, you will have a good time trying.",
"A previously untapped talent may emerge today, Virgo. You could decide to train this talent and create a new skill that can help you with just about any type of work you'd be doing. This is the day to do this. You should be full of energy and enthusiasm, capable of assuming any formidable task. You should be feeling physically strong and well. This is a day of challenges and new enterprises.",
"What's happening in your usually amicable relationships, Virgo? It seems you're looking for a fight. Could it be that someone has stolen a leadership position from you that you wanted? You tend to like being at the head of the group, and now you're confronted by resistance. So get involved in a new group project so that everyone will be reconciled. Think about going on a trip.",
"Don't deny your emotions today, Virgo. They will be of great use to you. There's an intensity about your feelings that's helping you stay strong in just about every situation. Opportunities lie within groups of people. Shared enthusiasm for a task makes the job go more quickly. Join others in the pursuit of prosperity.",
"Virgo, expect to meet someone new who will be a tremendous influence in your life - probably in your career. If you've been frustrated by your lack of progress up the corporate ladder, take heart. This new person may be able to show you another way up. In spite of your frustration, you should continue to work in your usual manner. You're on the right path, even though you may doubt it now.",
"Be aware that you might feel overshadowed or that your efforts won't be recognized, Virgo. You could feel like you do all the work for others and get nothing in return. The key is to make sure that you do the things you do because you want to. Do them for you. Don't do them for others because you expect that they will do something for you in return.",
"Your creative nature is at a peak today, Virgo, and the artist within you is tempted to come out and play. Indulge in a fantasy world that makes you happiest. Escapism may be a necessary element to the day in order to balance all the hard work you've been doing. Express yourself creatively through whatever means available.",
"There may be something or someone trying to slow you down today, Virgo. Maybe this is a sign that it's what you need to do. Don't fight the urge to sit on the couch and do nothing. Take this day to soak in a hot bath and recharge your spirit. Your personal possessions and security are of great importance now. Indulge in the good things that life has to offer.",
"You may feel like you're doomed if you do and doomed if you don't, Virgo. You may feel very opinionated about a certain issue, but you know that expressing yourself is likely to cause someone else to feel threatened or upset. But if you keep these thoughts to yourself, you're going to feel resentful and perhaps even used. You're better off expressing yourself honestly.",
"Engage in lively activities with friends who keep you abreast of the latest in culture, Virgo. See a movie, go to a bookstore, or visit a museum. This should be a fun time in which you can bounce ideas around and explore your thoughts and feelings. Be careful that your conversation doesn't lapse into gossip. Don't let everyone else's affairs suddenly become more important than yours.",
"Today is a great day for you. You should communicate a lot, Virgo. Talk in riddles and say your sentences backward. Be fanciful and outlandish. Most of the information will be relayed in a nonverbal manner. Let your wild side shine through. Wear the wackiest thing in your closet. Don't give in to the social norm just because it's the thing that has been done repeatedly.",
"You may feel as if someone or something has just reformatted your hard drive, Virgo. Suddenly things are running much more smoothly. The key now is to find the discipline and organization to understand this new system fully. Streamline your thoughts and be more efficient about how you use your energy. You'll be more effective overall if you can keep from scattering your resources.",
"You may feel a great urge to dive headfirst into a project, Virgo. Perhaps there's a plot of ground that you want to turn into a garden. Dig your hands into the soil. Maybe there's a craft or art form that you can't wait to learn about and develop. Be careful that you don't start too many different projects and leave them all unfinished.",
"Mind your manners, Virgo, and open doors that you've never opened before. Maintain your principles and integrity as you venture forth into worlds unknown. Don't write people off without giving them a fair chance. Don't judge others. Give them an equal amount of respect. It may be hard to maintain a solid footing today, but you should try.",
"Follow your heart instead of your wallet, Virgo. Start with yourself and choose where to spend your resources. Take an active role and be on the lookout for opportunities to grab hold of and profit from. You may find a conflict going on in your world. Stand up for what you believe in and don't be afraid to rock the boat.",
"People may be coming on strong, but you will be right there to meet them with an equally powerful rebuttal, Virgo. The problem is, the person who confronts you is talking about apples and you're talking about oranges. Get off your soapbox for a minute and listen to the real issue. Don't get caught in misunderstandings or things could backfire later.",
"Virgo, do you feel like you're in a video game and about to get eaten by a monster? Today you should try a new game - avoiding stress! Whether this concerns your career or personal life, you need to find some neutral territory where you can relax. How about going to a friend's house?",
"You may be thinking about everything you need to do to improve your work situation. You've made your demands clear, but no one seems to be paying attention. Maybe you've approached the wrong people. This could be just the excuse you've always needed to become your own boss. You have creativity and sound business ideas, Virgo. Why not see if you can combine the two?",
"Life is helping you out at the moment, Virgo. You might chalk it up to some divine power. Whatever it is, your guardian angel is always by your side. Perhaps you'd like to begin something new in your life, like moving or changing lifestyles. At the moment you can do anything you want to do. It will all work out just fine!",
"By jumping around from place to place, Virgo, you may end up feeling like you're getting nowhere. Instead of tackling many different tasks, today is better spent focusing your energy on one. Start from ground level and work up. Get to the root of the problem and many of the related issues will simply dissolve as you work.",
"Embrace your loved ones, Virgo. Let your heart lead the way. Things will flow your way if you let them. Don't try to fight the good fortune that comes. If you try to force the door open, it won't budge. Knock gently and it will open by itself. You mind is quick today. Get things moving in a positive direction. Jump on the uphill spiral to success.",
"Your four walls could seem to be closing in on you today, Virgo. You might feel that you'll go crazy if you don't get out for a while. But responsibilities may keep you indoors anyway. It's important to get out. Take a brisk walk around the neighborhood, run a quick errand, return a book to the library. This should bring some relief, at least for now.",
"Some wonderful news may come to you today, Virgo, and this could send you into such excitement that it's difficult to concentrate on the situation at hand. This is OK for a while. Your friends and loved ones will probably understand. But at some point you need to come down to Earth! Take a walk and work off the excitement. That might be just what you need.",
"Have you been expecting an important letter, Virgo? If so, it may not arrive for a while. If it doesn't appear today, call the person who sent it and ask for a duplicate because the original could be lost in the mail. Better to have two copies than wait for one that will never come.",
"Lucky you! An unexpected break could come your way that gets you started in just the direction you've wanted to follow. This could involve love, career aspirations, or simply a new way of living that you've been longing to experience. Friends might play a major role in this process. Move ahead cautiously, but move ahead. Breaks like this don't come very often!",
"Today represents a beginning in many ways. A friend from the past could reappear in your life, Virgo, and bring up memories both pleasant and disconcerting. Don't worry too much about it. This probably represents a much-needed release. You might also become involved with a group that embodies goals about which you're passionate. New friends could also come your way. Expect a few surprises from all sides!",
"You may decide to duck out of extra responsibilities today, Virgo, perhaps to have a private celebration at home with your love partner! The fun might be delayed if your beloved is unexpectedly called away for a while. Just remember that quality is better than quantity!",
"Today you might be eagerly awaiting a phone call that never seems to come from a current or potential romantic partner, Virgo. This could awaken your insecurity and cause you to think the worst. You should be relieved when the call finally comes, probably in midafternoon. Relax, hang in there, and keep busy!",
"Keep up the positive self-esteem that you've been working on for the past several weeks, Virgo. This is one of those days when you'll be presented with a situation where you can demonstrate your courage and independent mind. Use your powerful spirit to overcome any fears you have. There's no reason to doubt yourself now. Feel free to strut your stuff.",
"You might put a lot of effort into the appearance of your house. Some people you'd like to impress could visit your home tonight, Virgo. You should be especially intuitive now, so don't be surprised if you anticipate what they'll say before they say it. Make it work for you! Success through entertaining and the astute use of intuition are highly indicated.",
"It's time to step up to the plate and take responsibility for the things you want to have happen, Virgo. It's one thing to talk about great visions and dreams, but the bottom line is that they'll continue to remain abstract concepts unless you work to develop them into something solid and tangible. Test this theory for yourself today.",
"Your hard work is paying off in ways that may not be noticeable to you now, Virgo. Things are flowing naturally, and you seem to have all your responsibilities under control. You may not be aware that this is so since it's easier to see when something's wrong than when something's going well. Take time to appreciate the incredible things you've created for yourself thanks to all your effort.",
"Don't be surprised if you're a little weepy today, Virgo. The day's planetary influences could enhance your sensitivity to everything, including your feelings. Let yourself cry if you need to - it can be cleansing. Try not to wallow too much, as things will look better tomorrow. Take good care of yourself today.",
"Consider putting your problem-solving skills to the test today, Virgo. You have a real flair for investigating situations and figuring out what happened. If something comes your way that seems mysterious, deal with the problem directly and wrestle out the truth. If you're baffled, use the process of elimination. Stick with it and you'll learn what's what in no time.",
"Try not to push away the very people who are there to help you, Virgo. Dumping your problems on others may be the thing that does just that. Recognize your uncomfortable feelings, but don't burden others with them. Your happiness is your responsibility. You'll feel much better about yourself if you take care of your own discomfort. Then you'll attract the people you love.",
"Take care of yourself if you feel tired, Virgo. There's no shame in slowing down or taking a day off if it's needed. If you can spend a day in bed, go for it. This can be more restorative than you know. If some things must get done, delegate or work on a laptop in bed. Take heed when your body tells you it's had enough. Give yourself the rest you need.",
"A strong desire for new romance, whether with a new or current partner, could prove overwhelming today, Virgo. You might be tempted to do whatever it takes to attain it. Don't plunge ahead - this isn't the day for it! It might cause problems. Go to a romantic movie or read a racy novel. Seek what you want in a few days. You should have better results by then!",
"Don't be surprised if you're pensive, Virgo. It's one of those days when daydreaming can happen more readily. Your imagination may also be at a peak. Rather than fighting this so you can be more productive, jot your ideas down. It may be to your advantage, as better and innovative ways of doing things can pop into your mind. Take time to ponder. It can bring great results.",
"Today your creativity might be stimulated by some free time, Virgo. You can try and save it for later, but you may not feel the same way then. Try to apply your creativity to a faster or more efficient way to do a particular job or make a dull job more exciting. If you can't give in to that urge now, write down your ideas and plan to return to them soon.",
"Today you could feel especially adventurous, Virgo. You might be tempted to take part in risky adventures like hiking in the wilderness. This isn't a good day for it. Plan a trip for the near future if you want to, but today it's better to sublimate your adventurous nature by reading thrillers, watching spy movies, or exploring places close to home.",
"Charge ahead and use your emotions to fuel your fire, Virgo. You have plenty of mental acumen today that can help break through any puzzle. New beginnings are underway in many areas of your life. There's no reason to delay any longer than you already have. Take this opportunity to live up to your full potential and make things happen for yourself.",
"Today you could visit a friend who's recuperating from an illness or injury, Virgo. This person may be bored and antsy, and you should be prepared to hear all about the frustrations. Your friend needs a sympathetic ear, so listen. Someday you might want someone to do the same for you! Be supportive without agreeing with every complaint. Your friend needs company, not coddling.",
"Large social gatherings, perhaps group events or festivals, could put you in the middle of an agitated crowd, Virgo. At first it could seem exhilarating, but after a while you could feel stifled. Still, you won't want to miss anything, so you'll be in a quandary. It's OK to leave for a while and come back. The crowd should dissipate somewhat by the time you return.",
"Long-term trends are coming to a favorable point for you, Virgo. This is a good day to examine them and make some moves forward in pursuit of your goals. There's a great deal of energy working in your favor today and asking you to take charge and lead the fight toward a better reality. Get out of bed early and get moving.",
"The answer for you today is \"yes.\" Explore, reach out, and expand your mind to the far corners of your world and beyond, Virgo. There's no need to be tied down to reality. Don't restrict yourself to linear thinking. Take time out and enjoy the clouds. Information you receive should be extremely helpful in the pursuit of your wildest dreams.",
"An angry call from someone who lives far away might catch you off guard today, Virgo. In your mind, the person has no reason to be angry and is blowing things out of proportion. They probably won't listen to reason. Say as calmly as you can that you'll get in touch tomorrow and then hang up. Give this person time to calm down before even trying to straighten things out.",
"A long-term project reaches a positive conclusion, one that may have a dramatic impact on your finances. You've sold your manuscript to a publisher or successfully concluded a project that's dear to your heart. This success should give you the confidence you need, Virgo. Don't forget to take time to celebrate!",
"There's tension all around you, so you'll be happiest spending as much time by yourself as possible, Virgo. If you must interact with people, keep your communication clear and concise. There's room for misunderstanding, which could result in a major blowup over a minor event. It simply isn't worth the trouble being with people today. Seclusion is the only place where you'll find peace.",
"A social event could put you in touch with a magnetic woman who has a lot of interesting stories to tell, Virgo. She probably exaggerates, so don't take every detail as fact, but you'll enjoy meeting her anyway. Don't commit to any proposal that you and she work on a project together. She can be very convincing, but you'll need to think about it carefully before deciding.",
"Usually your mind is sharp and centered, Virgo, but today you'll probably feel like you can't think straight. Your thoughts might be vague and disjointed. If there's something you need to do immediately, either make a great effort to focus on the task at hand or get some help. Otherwise, leave major chores or decisions for another day. You'll be your old self again tomorrow.",
"Your mind might be on power struggles that have caused quarrels among your friends, placing you in an uncomfortable position. Conflicting loyalties might come up when others draw you into the fray, Virgo. Stay out of it! You could get angry, and this wouldn't do you any good. Think of something else until you calm down and regain your perspective.",
"You're ready to soar like a bird, Virgo. When the next gust of wind comes up, you'll take flight and send your beautiful presence all over the world. Try not to spread yourself too thin, but feel free to soar to every corner of the field. There's an expansive feeling in the air today that gives a boost to your emotions.",
"Adventure is always one of your main priorities, Virgo. Today you might have your mind on a type of adventure that you've never tried before. You might consider climbing a mountain, exploring Rome, or visiting the South Pacific. Whatever it is you want to do, you'd better start making serious plans now or you'll be too antsy for words.",
"Emotions could run high among those close to you, Virgo. It might seem like everyone is in a bad mood! In your own relations with them, your friendly nature and social skills will calm them down and keep them on an even keel, at least when you're around! Social events may keep you busy. You could make some valuable contacts.",
"If you aren't the most self-assured person in the world, Virgo, take a look around and see all that you've done. True, you still have many unattained dreams, but look at how many you've already realized. A lack of confidence in your abilities is holding you back. There's a moment for everyone when a leap of faith is required. It's time for you to jump.",
"There's excitement today that indicates that things are happening, things are changing. Stay alert and in tune with what's going on around you, Virgo. There's a wonderful energy charge urging you to push the boundaries of everything going on around you. Do your part to help the world evolve to a happier, more peaceful place.",
"You might need to take a step back today and turn your attention inward instead of outward. When it comes to love and romance, don't rush things. Patience is needed now more than ever. People are much more emotional than usual. Don't be surprised if you or someone you know becomes territorial when a stranger steps on his or her private turf.",
"Today you may plan a long journey to a place you've never been, probably in the company of a lover or close friend. The excitement of making the arrangements brings you closer, and a great time is promised. Romance looks good, as increased communication between you and your special someone is strongly indicated. The two of you may have an exciting evening out.",
"Career matters may force you into the public eye just when you'd prefer to sequester yourself and work alone. This could be frustrating, but significant financial benefits could depend on it. So come out of your shell and meet your public! In the end, you'll be glad you did. You could make some great contacts and even some new friends.",
"A radical transformation of your daily routine is definitely in the wind. You may decide to get an advanced degree or move to a foreign country or become more involved with a group. Even for someone as adventurous as you, this particular change might seem outrageous. Don't worry about it. Follow your heart. Such opportunities often arise only once in a lifetime!",
"Today seems to have a rather aggressive atmosphere. Things may heat up quite a bit, so be prepared for blasts of intense energy coming at you from others. If you're the one dishing it out, make sure you're prepared to receive it right back. You're much more sensitive than you look.",
"Business colleagues or prospective partners could visit today. The meeting promises to be cooperative, rewarding, and fruitful. Any partnership formed now shows promise of being a step in the right direction. You might fantasize about how you're going to spend all the money you're going to make. This is fine as long as you postpone actually spending it until you have the money in your hands.",
"A group activity, perhaps a festival of some kind, could bring new information and people into your life. You could meet people from all over the world and lifestyles. You might also discover some new products you want to try. This experience could transform you in a profound way, so don't expect to go back to your routine immediately.",
"Draw your strength from your sense of self. There isn't another person like you, so capitalize on this and move forward in the way that only you can. There's a great deal of bravery in your heart asking you to take risks that you may not have considered before. There are opportunities just waiting for you and no one else.",
"Friendships go surprisingly well for you now, so look to them for the support you seek. Future plans may be uncertain, so don't worry about them now. It's important to bask in each moment and give thanks for every breath. You should feel good, so take aggressive action.",
"Your emotions are piqued today. You're spurred to take action. People might have a me-first attitude that may get on your nerves. You're more interested in the collective and improving the situation for all. Someone may be working counter to this mode of action, causing friction in your dealings. Stick to your principles and act confidently.",
"You tend to be unconventional, but today you could outdo even you. A spiritual experience could be at the heart of it. You're changing in ways that are obvious to everyone. Don't worry if they're confused. You'll be confused, too. Think of yourself as a caterpillar becoming a butterfly! The transition may be strange, but the butterfly is far lovelier than the caterpillar!",
"Know what you're getting yourself into, especially if it has to do with love and romance. You may be like a fly on a tree branch, carefully inspecting the beautiful spider web at your feet. You're tempted to step on the silky strands, yet once you place one foot on the sticky web, you'll be tangled there for a long time - maybe forever.",
"Happiness reigns in the home as your household continues to experience success. Someone new may come to visit. Expect a lot of comings and goings, plus an impromptu party or two. Meditation and contemplation could provide inspiration for new projects, and you might spend some time writing down ideas and brainstorming ways to approach them.",
"There's a powerful movement of energy in your life now. Major overhauls and subsequent undertakings are just waiting for you to give the green light. Realize the potential of instigating a significant change in your life. Don't shy away from the unknown. You understand the need for upheaval. Chaos may be necessary in order to let new opportunities in.",
"Today you'll meet a very compatible and exciting circle of new friends. These people may be from foreign countries, or they might be involved in professions in religion, law, or education. They'll feel like kindred spirits. You'll be able to talk with them for hours. Whatever their circumstances, these people could be your friends for life.",
"A tremendous burst of creative energy regarding a cherished project could hit today. Inspiration could strike, and you'll want to turn as much of that into physical reality as possible. Don't be disappointed if your insights are exhausted quickly and you hit a roadblock. Don't try to force it. Stop working for now and take it up later. The inspiration will come again!",
"Today you may be obsessed with romance. Racy novels could be especially appealing, and you might try some experiments with how you look in order to enhance your sex appeal. If you try to schedule an intimate encounter with a partner, don't be surprised if there are obstacles, such as your friend's work. You might have to wait until tomorrow!",
"Dark dreams may haunt your sleep and cause you to awaken in the night. The dreams probably represent nothing more than your unconscious mind releasing the darkest of your worries, fears, and frustrations that you've been going through over the past week. A closer study of what the symbols mean to you could be enlightening. Write them down!",
"If you're feeling restless today, don't fight it. Use your energy to do something physical. Go for a walk or play tennis. Anything that helps you release the excess energy will feel good. It's important that you pay attention to your body's signals. Getting a good night's rest will have you feeling refreshed tomorrow. You'll be able to deal with the tasks at hand.",
"With the current aspects, you can expect positive job changes. You've worked hard these past few months and contributed important ideas. Don't be surprised if you get rewarded with recognition, raise, or promotion. Go out and celebrate with friends tonight. You deserve a night on the town. Nothing would give you more pleasure than treating your loved ones to dinner.",
"Today your imagination should be flowing freely. You could channel this into creative work, or you could come up with some ingenious ways to advance your business interests. The next few days could find your mind in overdrive and working on whatever ideas you come up with today. Write them down. You'll want to remember them all.",
"You may feel like the walls are closing in on you. Don't let it happen. Do whatever you need to do to rejuvenate your spirits and motivation. You may have gotten bogged down in some rather dull responsibilities or obligations. You're too bright to squander your mind that way. Take a break from routine and go for a night on the town. You'll enjoy dancing the night away!",
"Try to be extra patient and affectionate toward your loved ones today. A child, lover, or pet needs some of the special attention and reassurance that only you can provide. Try to make this a priority over professional obligations. Remember that your loved ones are the most important things in your life. When you need them, they'll always be there for you!",
"Today's celestial configuration may leave you feeling more spiritually inclined than usual. As your thoughts turn to more positive horizons, you'll be optimistic about your future and the future of humanity. Don't hesitate to express these opinions to others. They'll be cheered by your point of view.",
"Your emotions are dynamic and extreme today. They're apt to control every action you take whether you realize it or not. Be aware that it's best to realize it so you can then control these volatile feelings instead of being controlled by them. This doesn't mean you should try to ignore them by pretending they don't exist.",
"A group with which you've been involved could receive recognition for good work that you may have spearheaded. Or a friend could receive some sort of public acknowledgment that reflects on you. Long-term goals may suddenly come together for you, winding up months of hard work, bringing you well-earned success and recognition.",
"There's a fast-paced energy in the air that suggests a dramatic change of some sort in your life. Things may not go so well for you if you fail to notice the opportunities open to you. You may not need to work so hard simply because so many things are going your way. Consider ways in which you can prepare for the future. The good times won't last forever.",
"You may want to take a more judicious approach to your shopping sprees. Try spending the afternoon looking and trying on but not buying. That way, you'll have time to reflect on whether or not you really want and need the items. This could help cut out a lot of impulse spending. Your wallet will be fatter and happier.",
"You like people but sometimes you can be very critical. Today you may have a hard time integrating yourself into a group. The group dynamic may not appeal to you. All you want to do is break away. Try to overcome that feeling and observe your resistance. Try to find your place in the group and play along without faking it.",
"You likely want to take the day off, perhaps to take care of an unfinished creative project you've been working on for some time. But you aren't likely to get very far since disagreements within your friends keep your mind occupied and you may be upset. Despite it all, try to stay focused. That's the only way to get anything accomplished.",
"You're probably getting a lot of great news today. Business and personal success are coming your way. A project that you've hoped would turn a profit may finally be moving that way. Financial gain is imminent. Your enthusiasm, self-confidence, and optimism should be very high as a result, making you that much more apt to move forward.",
"Your lively, imaginative spirit is in tune with the collective. The need for a worldly consciousness and evolving humanity has become more obvious to you as time goes by. These issues come up today, but don't be surprised if you get a reality check. Your dreams may be unrealistic. Someone could try to burst your bubble, so be careful. Don't lose sight of your goals.",
"It's important to remain flexible, but not so much that you can't make a decision about anything. Your head says one thing while your heart says another. When you give both of them free rein in an effort to be as flexible as possible, they go in opposite directions. Postpone making any important decisions until your path becomes clearer.",
"It's an excellent day for you! Although no major events occur today, there's the promise of freedom in the coming months. A fundamental shift is about to occur in your occupation and love life. As the months unfold, you can expect to be more visionary, more creative, and perhaps more rebellious. You'll be much more effective than in the past two or three years.",
"You look especially attractive today. Your communications skills are good. While romantic matters are low-key, love relationships could still advance. Interesting conversations with your love interest could reveal parts of you that your friend finds intriguing, and bring up interests in common that you didn't know you had. Make the most of it!",
"A number of young visitors could come to your home with news to pass on and information to share. You'll probably spend most of your day working around the house or yard, which you enjoy very much. Conversations feed your intellect and get your curiosity going. You'll feel very positive about whatever you choose to do.",
"Home responsibilities may increase markedly today, leaving you feeling like you're the only member of the household getting anything done. You might give in to gloom, but don't dwell on it for too long. You will feel a lot better if you pitch in and take care of whatever needs to be done and then treat yourself by going out to celebrate. Go to a movie, or better yet, a concert.",
"Today you might be catapulted into the public eye in some way - and you won't be very comfortable there! If you're teaching, speaking, or leading a discussion group, it might be a good idea to seek the support of someone who has a stronger gift of gab than you. This person could be a close friend or a love partner. Don't worry. With help, you'll be fine!",
"The climate is tense today. You'll be aware of a feeling of restlessness and a longing for change, but you'll also be reluctant to make any real moves in that direction. Your judgment tells you that complaints that don't lead to action are meaningless. So why not be the catalyst that provokes some action?",
"Group activities or meetings could prove fraught today as those around you get pulled into discussions about which they feel strongly and on which they don't all agree! This isn't a good day to get involved in heated discussions even if you find the idea tempting. Stay out of it! Find someone who's also staying out of it and talk to that person.",
"Get involved with the energy of today so you don't get left out of the loop. Your contribution to the group is important. You should foster positive relationships among all parties. Think big. You can do no wrong by expanding your mind out into the minds of others. Make a commitment to quench your thirst for knowledge and freedom through information.",
"When it comes to issues regarding romance, don't hold back today. Things are working in your favor. You shouldn't hesitate to act forcefully and confidently. Show others that you're serious. Don't back down as things heat up even more. This is a sign that things are progressing in your favor and you shouldn't mistake this intensity for anything but true passion.",
"Long-term trends are lining up in your favor. You're at a pivotal point in which you can latch onto something big and take off with it. Let your dreams expand. Telling people how to run their lives will get you nowhere. Lead by example. Follow your creative intuition and explore more of the things that make you truly happy.",
"A new romance could come your way. An old friend could suddenly seem like more to you, sending the relationship in an entirely new direction. The opposite could happen, too. An old love could reappear and resurrect the intellectual side of your relationship, making a new friend out of an old love. Circumstances around you are changing and so are you. You're the type to welcome it!",
"Today you should feel especially idealistic, imaginative, intuitive, and spiritually inclined. You project an otherworldly aura that attracts more attention, such as admiring glances, than you're used to. Love matters should be going well now, as a fairytale atmosphere permeates your life. Enjoy it while you can. You'll be back to reality in a few days!",
"Go out and see a movie that you've wanted to see for weeks. You'll be happiest in a reality that isn't necessarily yours. Fantasy and imaginative scenarios are what tickle your fancy now. Be careful of being weighed down by heavy emotional issues that don't have anything to do with you.",
"Today you need to address financial issues. You may have to find a bit of extra money in your bank account or budget. Chances are this isn't a large sum, but enough to make a difference to you now. Take care of it and then settle down for a peaceful evening at home. You won't feel like going out, but you'll enjoy your evening.",
"This is a good time to make decisions that bring together your need for practicality as well as desire for emotional freedom. It's important for your mental health to have faith in your fantasies and your ability to see them through to fruition. There's a special portal open for you today with your name on it.",
"Sit back and receive instead of trying to make things happen by imposing your will. You're always taking action and directing your energy outward. Think about ways you can direct your energy inward and watch how this draws people to you. If nothing else, you'll learn something about yourself by being more attentive to your thoughts and emotions.",
"There's power when you discover how to be part of two opposing teams. At first it may seem like treason to be part of one as you help the other. In fact, you're helping yourself by learning both sides of the situation. Take the best qualities from each. When it comes time to put together your team, you'll have all the secrets needed to succeed.",
"A desire to learn through a group activity - a lecture or workshop, perhaps - might put you in the middle of a crowd. You'll find it exhilarating. If you're planning to attend such an event, don't go alone. Your enjoyment will be heightened by the presence of a close friend or your partner.",
"If you aren't romantically involved, expect that status to change today. You could meet more than one attractive person! A new person could come into your life or an old friend could suddenly seem more appealing than you thought. If you're involved, expect the energy around your partner to change. He or she could seem happier, funnier, stronger, so much so that you fall in love all over again.",
"Today you may come up with some attractive new ideas to advance your career and increase your income. The only question is whether or not you can follow through. Some of them may be workable and some may not, but if you're serious, you should do some research to figure that out. The future looks good if you take the necessary steps to turn your ideas into reality.",
"A letter or call from someone you know who's ill and confined to the hospital or home might come today. You might decide to pay this person a visit. You may not know him or her well, but your humanitarian instincts are awakened. Take care of business that needs to be handled and then go see this person. You'll feel better for it.",
"Certain areas of your life are expanding rapidly, causing you to lose touch with the more romantic aspects. The more you reach out in one direction, the more deprived you feel in the opposite direction. Perhaps you need more input as to where you put your energy. It's time to focus your attention on things that are working well instead of dwelling on things that are going nowhere.",
"Falling in love at first sight is something you never thought would happen, but it could happen today. A romantic involvement may follow or not, but the high you get from meeting a new person will make you feel better about yourself and life.

"If you've been thinking about working out of your home, this is the time to put your plans into action. Anything regarding money or the home could succeed now. All signs indicate that your hard work and determination will bring the results you want. An older visitor might drop by, perhaps with advice or ideas you'll want to consider.",
"Unlike other occasions, today you'll display your true feelings. Even when you hide them they're still there, deep inside you. You may think that showing your feelings is a sign of weakness, but today you'll show the world that your heart isn't made of stone, and you'll let yourself go.",
"Today let your emotions mingle with your thoughts. What good is telling yourself that you must like something if you really can't stand it? What good are grand principles if your heart isn't in them? Take the time to put your head in sync with your heart today.",
"Friends are an important part of your life. As you get older you'll find that they become even more so. Today you may enlarge your circle of friends by one or many. Perhaps you'll join a group with similar interests to yours. Perhaps you'll be introduced to someone with whom you feel an immediate connection. Whatever it is, this person or persons will greatly enrich your life.",
"You might have gotten home later last night than is good for you, and you may feel a little tired and dragged out. Take your vitamins and don't use coffee as a stimulant.

Watch out that those late nights don't become a habit!",
"Flowers and fresh plants can perk up your mood as well as your home. You may feel your abode is looking a bit shabby. Simple tricks to improve its appearance will do wonders for your outlook.

"Today you may have so much to do around the house that you don't know where to start. Family members aren't much help. Don't throw up your hands and let it all go. Look around the room, find something that needs to be done, and handle it. Keep doing this and then stop when you're tired. There's no need to work yourself to exhaustion even if you expect visitors. Their homes get messy, too!",
"It's time to expand your horizons. No more waiting around for events to change of their own accord. You've grown up enough to realize that if change is going to happen, you have to make it happen. As a result, today is busier than most as you begin to execute all those ideas you've been thinking about.",
"The last several days have been a bit of an ordeal, so you could be surprised by the brightness of the day ahead.

Take advantage of the joys ahead without subjecting them to too much scrutiny.",
"You're likely to take things to heart a bit more than usual. Dramatic changes in your environment and attitude will keep you on your toes. The wonderful thing about this is that you'll gain a great deal of insight and understanding of other people. You'll be more aware of other people's feelings and perspectives, helping you make more educated decisions in your affairs.",
"Move away from the problems instead of stepping into them. You may not be able to see the potholes, so consider taking another road. Don't waste time falling into a hole you can avoid. It may be difficult to deal with your emotions because your usual way of dealing with such intensity is to push it away, ignore it, and operate on a cerebral level. This attitude won't serve you today.",
"The illness of a relative or neighbor might have you feeling downhearted today. The news is likely secondhand, so it might not be as bad as reported. Work may be slow on your own projects, as you could have a temporary mental block about what to do next. Perhaps you should put them aside for now. Once they're out of your conscious thoughts, the solution may come spontaneously.",
"Spiritual matters come to the forefront today. You'll want to throw yourself into the study of a spiritual or metaphysical discipline that appeals to you the most.

Take a long walk to clear your head so you can sleep.",

Be prepared for a great future, and start enjoying it now!",

"You're off to an excellent start. If you've felt a little weary lately, this will change. Added mental and physical strength is available to you.

Things will be finished before you know it, and you'll still have a smile on your face. Know when to quit, though. You don't want to overdo it.",
"Be careful of letting your erratic, willful nature dominate the scene. Go with the flow and be more sensitive to the people around you. Stay grounded, focused, and aware of your emotions.
