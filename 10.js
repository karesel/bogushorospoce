exports.arr = ["This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn. You should find that the puzzle pieces naturally come together almost effortlessly. Important connections can be made today as long as you keep all the lines of communication open. Information exchange is a key part of bringing people and ideas together in a constructive manner. A burst of inspiration can lead to a rewarding journey through time and space.",
"Your heart is going pitter-pat, Capricorn, and you're tempted to escape into a romantic fantasyland in which you play the starring role. The bad news is that something may be trying to hold you back today. It could be that your conscience is coming on the scene to remind you that work needs to be done before you can go off into your own little fairytale world.",
"The heaviness of the day weighs on you, Capricorn. Take your time with projects and carefully evaluate all the facts before making a decision. People can be deceptive, so be careful in all your dealings. You may be going through a period in which you care less about material possessions and concern yourself with spiritual things. This is a great time to delve into the occult.",
"Try to stay disciplined and focused today, Capricorn. This may be easier said than done, but it's crucial for preserving your sanity. There's a restrictive, weighty air to the day that may put a damper on your jovial nature. Instead of getting down on yourself, use this energy to your advantage and make order out of the chaos in your life. Eat a healthy meal and share your thoughts with others.",
"The early part of the day might find you sluggish and indecisive, Capricorn, but later you should be psyched up and ready to go. Today marks the beginning of a new period in which you should set your ideas in motion. Action is the key. Think before you speak and use caution when talking about other people. Make sure your discussions about others don't turn into gossip.",
"You feel especially sexy right now. A powerful feeling of love and a need to physically express it could be with you all day. If you're involved, you want to spend a romantic evening with your lover. If you aren't, you could channel the energy into creative activities. Romantic novels and movies are poor substitutes for the real thing, Capricorn, but if they're all that's available, go for it.",
"Spiritual concerns and fanciful daydreams move into sharp focus today, Capricorn. Perhaps you're pulled by playful emotions and escapism. Keep one foot on the ground while you send your mind into the clouds, but definitely take time to check the air up there and report your findings to your conscious self. You may feel a greater sensitivity toward others now while your intuition is strong.",
"Today you might have insights as to how to advance your career. These could come your way through dreams, sudden revelations, or perhaps visions. Don't hesitate to put them into action simply because of the unorthodox way they come to you, Capricorn. Some of the most progressive and successful ideas have come because the inventor had a vivid dream. Write down your insights and go for it.",
"New scientific or archaeological discoveries could temporarily shake your faith in your spiritual path, Capricorn. You may suddenly doubt something you've always accepted. This could propel you to study, primarily to reaffirm your faith. You're likely to find that your discoveries don't invalidate your ideas, but actually confirm them. Write down your ideas so you can put things in proper perspective.",
"You're a logical person, Capricorn. When insights come to you through ESP, you tend to doubt their validity. Don't do this. If a feeling is particularly strong, go with it. Don't write it off because it seems illogical. Life isn't always predictable. If you give yourself permission, you can trust your intuition about nearly anything.",
"You might feel on edge today but not know why. You may jump at unexpected noises or think you see or hear things that aren't there. You aren't going crazy. This is caused by the current planetary configuration. The best way to relieve the jumpiness is to get some exercise - at least take a walk. In the evening, read an engrossing book.",
"This should be a stimulating day, Capricorn. The possibility of a journey might arise unexpectedly. This could be exciting as some close friends or a romantic partner might accompany you. A new turn in your intellectual or spiritual interests could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour. You will want to learn more about it. The Internet could have useful information. Make the most of it.",
"Artistic or spiritual inspiration could come your way today, Capricorn, although it might be muddled and you could be perplexed about how to deal with it. Don't try to force the issue. Write down your ideas and return to them later. Someone close might feel unwell, and you may want to spend some time with him or her. This might take some effort, but it won't go unappreciated.",
"Intuition plays a large part in your work, Capricorn. You're apt to sense what others want or need and foresee the consequences of one course of action over another. This is definitely going to make a positive difference in what you accomplish. You're likely to be quite pleased with what you do. Exercise this intuition today so it will stay with you in the future.",
"Intellectual and spiritual discussions should bring you even closer to people dear to you, Capricorn. Relations with a romantic partner should be especially warm and intimate today. You're in a philosophical frame of mind, so you might want to attend a lecture. Expect new insights to come your way. Books, magazine articles, and websites could also prove enlightening.",
"So many ideas are flooding your mind today that you might have trouble sorting them out if you don't write them down, Capricorn. They could involve travel, education, group activities, writing, and publishing. You might want to discuss them with friends or members of a group to which you belong. Your mind is in the clouds, so practical matters could seem tedious.",
"Memories of past events that caused traumas that you're still dealing with could come to light today. This is a positive development, as the release of these old emotions could make it possible for you to progress more quickly on material and spiritual planes. You may feel lighter, and you could experience a rush of joy. In the evening, go dancing and work off some of this energy.",
"Some great news could change your life forever. It might involve a new partnership of some kind or opportunities in your community. At the least, Capricorn, it could involve changes in your outlook and attitudes about life. You could spend a lot of time on the phone with friends and acquaintances. You will probably want to schedule a romantic evening with your partner.",
"Today is a great day for you. You should enjoy a great deal of playful conversation, Capricorn. Fantasy is likely to play a big role in events, and you may daydream as you walk down the street. Don't bother with reality if you don't have to. You're much better off keeping the tone light and playful. Enjoy your fantasy world and feel free to invite others into it.",
"The health of a friend or family member who lives far away may be a bit worrying today, Capricorn. A lack of contact with this person doesn't help matters. You're usually the type to phone at the drop of a hat, but today you're less inclined to do this. You shouldn't make yourself crazy. If there's someone else you can ask, do so. Otherwise, take the initiative and call.",
"If you've been thinking about studying astrology, numerology, or other occult sciences, Capricorn, this is the day to start. There may be a school or teacher that you've been considering. By doing this, you could open doors to new knowledge, meet new friends who share your interests, and steer your life in a fascinating new direction. Pick up the phone and take the first step.",
"You're never at a loss for an opinion, Capricorn, and today is no exception. The energy of the day is such that you're happier listening to conversations than participating in them. You can't help but smile at the misinformation that gets bandied about. Since no one has bothered to ask for your opinion, you aren't about to offer it today. Tomorrow is another matter entirely.",
"Creativity and romance are a good combination, Capricorn, and today both are in top form. Why not get out the good stationery and craft a love note that will set that special someone's heart aflutter? Cater to your romantic nature, ideally with a partner at your side. Even if you're alone, a bubble bath will do wonders for your soul.",
"Have you been lethargic lately? If so, today is your wakeup call. You will be alert and clear about the task at hand. You understand that your help is urgently needed, and that there's no time to waste. You can expect to pour a great deal of energy into a single, well-defined goal today. If you usually wander from project to project, this will be a change for you, Capricorn.",
"Relations with partners of all kinds - business, romantic, creative - might be somewhat strained today, Capricorn. You and the other parties involved may have been under a lot of stress, and you could be snapping at each other. It might be a good idea to keep contact between you to a minimum. If you can't, try to be cordial and cooperative even if you don't feel like it.",
"Today might be one of the most fortunate days of your life, Capricorn. Everything you've been striving for - romance, money, creative fulfillment - could fall into place at various times today. Expect exciting calls bringing good news. A lover could offer congratulations. The only downside is that all the stimulation could leave you exhausted. Never mind. You will sleep well!",
"An unexpected problem with a task you're trying to finish could cause a temporary upset between you and those closest to you, Capricorn. This might have your family stomping out of the house in anger. Remember that everybody has their own concerns, and probably wouldn't have reacted this way otherwise. Finish what you have to do and patch things up later. All should be well.",
"A rush of intense love and romantic passion for a special someone might turn your mind toward marriage, Capricorn. The wedding of a friend may contribute to these thoughts. Your partner may still have doubts about moving to the next level of commitment, even though there's no question that he or she truly loves you. Be patient and hold your tongue. You will know when the time is right.",
"All the success and good fortune you've enjoyed over the past several months may have freed you from the grind enough to concentrate on spiritual or artistic interests. There may be a few surprises in store for you, Capricorn. You may meet some new people who share your interests. What you learn from them could improve your progress. You might embark on a new course of study.",
"A social event could bring you into contact with some interesting people in fascinating fields, Capricorn, some from distant places. Discussions could turn you on to one or more new interests, which you will probably want to pursue later. You might receive an invitation to visit an exotic place. If you're single, you could meet a potential lover. This will be an evening to remember.",
"A temporary separation from a love partner might have you in a very gloomy mood, Capricorn. Attempts to reach your friend by phone might prove fruitless. You might grow more and more frustrated and angry. There isn't much you can do other than leave messages. Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Find something else to do until your friend has a chance to call. Better late than never.",
"You may have let household tasks and chores go for a few days, Capricorn, so today you might decide to get them all done at once. You have the energy and the stamina to do it. However, take care not to get too caught up in little details that only you tend to notice. This can keep you from getting the most important chores done.",
"In case you're surrounded by a lot of people today, you can look forward to a very harmonious day, Capricorn. Your sensitivity is higher than usual, so you will be better able to understand others and be understood as well. As a result, you add another bond to your relationships, which will create happiness and joy in your heart.",
"Social events or group activities could prove more stimulating than usual, Capricorn. Discussions of every subject imaginable could take place around you, and you might have trouble deciding which ones you want to join. Your mind may be going the speed of light by the time the gathering ends. Walk home if time and weather permit. That should clear your head enough to let you sleep well.",
"Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Capricorn, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as computers and other equipment used in such arrangements are likely to malfunction, and you could end up frustrated.",
"You may wonder why increased intuition has seemed to replace your usual logical self. An unexpected intellectual, spiritual, or metaphysical insight might come to you from another realm. It may seem so profound that you wonder if it really came from you. Write it down in detail. Whatever you come up with is going to keep you in the clouds all day, Capricorn. Don't trip or bump into anyone!",
"The promise of possible financial advancement could cause you to plunge into a lot of paperwork today. This could be related to a job, Capricorn, or it might involve a personal project that you've been working on. You might get so caught up in what you're doing that you lose your ability to focus and get too frazzled to finish. Remember to pace yourself and take breaks when you feel the need.",
"What would happen if you decided to take care of yourself today, Capricorn? This is what the planets are trying to tell you. You need to relax, to let yourself be taken care of, and close your eyes and dream. Leave the daily tasks behind. You need peace and quiet. Lie down and release all your worries. You don't need to act and you don't need to react. Just relax.",
"It scares you when life seems like it's slipping through your fingers and you can't slow it down. But it isn't life that's playing tricks on you. You aren't seeing things as clearly as you should be. You feel a little left out, but don't worry. You're just out of energy. Try and think of this empty feeling inside as a kind of purification or a much-needed break from everything.",
"After a recent financial problem, you've decided to take the bull by the horns and do what you need to do. You're used to being in control of a situation, and small financial worries aren't going to get you down. After all, money isn't everything. On top of your ability to react to a problem, your originality and self-sacrificing attitude will help you deal with this situation.",
"To those around you, you might appear to be your usual logical, rational self, Capricorn. Actually, you may be drawing a lot of your ideas and insights from deep within your psyche. You're probably drawing on experiences from your past, even if you aren't consciously aware of it. Even though the source is unorthodox, whatever you come up with is likely to have a lot of practical value.",
"A call from a romantic partner could lead to an intimate get-together, Capricorn. It's likely to be highly gratifying emotionally and bring you closer together. Passionate poetry and sexy novels could especially appeal to you right now. If you're into writing, you could channel your rush of sensuality into producing results that are so well thought out that they surprise even you. Get started!",
"Your internal computer just got upgraded today and your head is buzzing with all kinds of new information, Capricorn. The good news is that you should be able to process all these bytes at lightning speed. Act swiftly and with great confidence. You can do anything. You could even talk your way into the White House for dinner.",
"It would be a good idea to socialize with others today in a comfortable, open setting. Say what you feel instead of just concentrating on what you think, Capricorn. Be just as good a listener as you expect others to be for you. Join a writing circle or take a painting class. Your creativity is looking for an outlet today, so you might as well share this gift among friends.",
"Some unsettling news from far away could have you stressed out, Capricorn. This might affect your work if you aren't careful. Your mind may stray back and forth from work to the news and its implications. Stay focused. All signs are that whatever you've heard is likely to be far less troublesome than it appears right now. Don't fly off the handle until you know the facts.",
"All aspects of love and romance will go especially well today, Capricorn. You might take this opportunity to make a bold move toward the object of your affection. Go with an unconventional approach and move fearlessly. Your relationships will go well. Nurture your romantic side and communicate your feelings. Love will act suddenly and unexpectedly. Go with the flow.",
"You should be feeling especially passionate now, Capricorn, especially regarding partnerships. Romantic partnerships definitely call for an evening alone together. Professional and creative ones, on the other hand, call for a new project that you both believe in. Look to events in distant states or foreign countries for inspiration. Something begun far away from home could capture your imagination.",
"A task, perhaps job related or perhaps one of your own, might prove weightier than you expected. You're working too hard and you could be feeling tired and dejected, Capricorn. Exactly how crucial is it to get this done right now? If it isn't vital, get as much done as you can without compromising your well-being. Do the rest tomorrow. The world won't end if you take another day.",
"Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Capricorn. This may involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless. If you want to avoid an upset, try a little communicating. This is definitely the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.",
"Expect some great news regarding money, possibly involving professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to cry tears of joy, Capricorn. In a different vein, a close friend could be going through some changes and might want your support. Your best course of action would be to listen rather than give advice. You may have to control yourself if the situation defies all reason.",
"You may feel a bit weighed down today, Capricorn, and perhaps more reserved than usual. Someone may be raining on your parade, but don't let it get you down. Use the grounded energy of the day to get things done. You have your hands full with many tasks, so sit down and bring them to completion. Calm your nervous system and balance your frantic emotions. Ease off the caffeine.",
"Career and financial successes might finally come your way after months and perhaps years of striving, Capricorn. The emotional support you receive from those who've been working with you can be very gratifying, and it's likely to last for a long time. If you like what you're doing, chances are you will be doing it for a while. If you're committed to your profession, keep up the good work.",
"You may not be your usual cheery self today, Capricorn. Gloom may have come over you. You may doubt everything that happens in your life. No matter how promising a career, romance, or money matter seems, you think the worst. Treat yourself today. Get a massage, relax in a hot tub, and rub and soak out those doubting spirits. That will get you through the day. Tomorrow you will be back to normal.",
"Tap into your creativity to unblock the emotional flow today, Capricorn. This can be a powerful tool. Creativity is a big part of who you are, almost as big as communication. Your emotions link to these two aspects and constantly interact beneath the surface. If one gets blocked, release it by focusing on the other. Express yourself through creativity and consider talking to someone close.",
"Venturing into something new and different may be what you need, Capricorn. You have a very solid, practical side to your personality, but the need for excitement and adventure is likely to be just as strong. If you've had your nose to the grindstone recently, take some time off for fun. Visit a friend or, better yet, drive to a place you haven't been to and explore.",
"Take the time today to consider your health, Capricorn. Do you get enough rest, eat the right foods, take vitamins, exercise every day, go to the doctor when you need to, and take time to relax? All these help you have a lifetime of good health. Living a long, healthy life is something we all want. Start now to take care of your body.",
"Today, Capricorn, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially true if you've arrived at a resolution that solves a problem. Others may often try to change your decisions. Maybe this is because they succeed, but not today. The planetary aspects are working in your favor, and you will feel a new strength. Follow your own heart.",
"Use your creativity to make things happen today, Capricorn. Remember that creativity doesn't always take the form of a finished product. Use it to come up with innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust in your ability to discover such possibilities. You're an intelligent and creative person. Combine the two to make an unbeatable tool for finding solutions to almost anything.",
"Don't worry about being productive today, Capricorn. Thanks to the high energy provided by the planetary aspects, it might be one of the most efficient days you've had for a long time. Dig in your heels and go, go, go. Things will be accomplished in no time flat, with some to spare at that. If you have a creative hobby, enjoy working on it. You will find it rewarding.",
"The only good thing about being on an emotional roller coaster is that you never feel the same way for long. One moment you're up, the next you're down. You can't figure out what it is you want. Rather than drag your loved ones along on the ride, get away from your usual environment. You will be a lot better off alone. And something more important may come out of these moments of solitude!",
"Some great news about a friend's good fortune could be exciting, Capricorn, and you might spend a lot of time on the phone not only congratulating that friend but also discussing it with other people. This is good for you, as you're apt to find it inspiring and use it as motivation to continue pushing ahead yourself. In fact, this news could change your life profoundly in the long run.",
"You might find that your desire to conquer is active today, Capricorn, and that your mind is right in line with the urge to take action. Listen to this and stoke the internal fire. You will find that you can increase your circle of influence by a great deal as long as you're willing to take a decisive risk in how you approach every situation. Be bold and courageous in your actions.",
"You may find that you're indecisive when it comes to issues concerning love and romance, Capricorn. For some reason, you have a tendency to pull one way and then the other, yet neither way seems very rewarding. Don't feel like you have to take concrete action at this time. In fact, if you do, this commitment may cause you more frustration later.",
"A lot of letters, calls, or emails could come your way from all over, Capricorn, bringing lots of good news and useful information. Some of it could involve new and innovative opportunities that are of great interest to you. Expect a lot of discussion that could really get your mind going. Write down what seems most promising for you and leave the rest for others.",
"Enthusiasm for spiritual and metaphysical studies could have you feeling optimistic about the future. Your physical energy is high, Capricorn, and this suggests that you want to try yoga, tai chi, or another discipline that combines physical exercise with developing psychic and spiritual faculties. Friends could want to join you in this activity. Let the insights flow, and write them down.",
"A relationship that may have in the past been based primarily on intellectual interests may take a sudden turn toward romance. If you aren't careful, Capricorn, this could turn into an obsession! Relax and enjoy it, but accept your partner as he or she is - warts and all! There are indications of possible changes in your life, either on a personal or business level.",
"Take care that your self-esteem doesn't depend on what other people tell you, Capricorn. One minute a bit of flattery may send you high as a kite, and the next minute some criticism may have you feeling down in the dumps. Do your best to not let others blow you up and then deflate you as if you're nothing but a balloon.",
"You probably aren't going to impress people with your fast talk and quick facts today, Capricorn. You will likely get further if you express the emotions that lie behind your words. It's more important to say what you feel than what you think. Even though this may go against your usual nature, you will find that it's the best policy on a day like this.",
"Today you might plan a quick trip by air, Capricorn. This could be business related. Someone else may have been meant to go but couldn't, so you may be taking his or her place. This could be disruptive for you, but if you make an effort, you can turn it into an adventure. It's always best to go with the flow and make the most of it.",
"Nervous tension among family members is high today, Capricorn, so don't be surprised if household members start quarreling. It's best to keep them apart most of the day if you can. In the evening, encourage them to talk about what's bothering them. You may be feeling a bit bored and discouraged, but forget about it by keeping busy. This will all pass by tomorrow.",
"Today is a domestic sort of day. You've been neglecting your home recently and now is a good time to make up for it. Clear out the clutter and get organized. If you're ambitious, you might even want to try a little cooking. Why else have you been saving magazine recipes? You will enjoy the result of getting things in order and allowing yourself the pleasure of a positive day.",
"Today you may wake up feeling energetic, enthusiastic, optimistic, and very happy, Capricorn. You may not be able to trace this to anything logical, so don't even try. Make the most of what's happening and use that energy to create the life you want. You might feel like you can move mountains, but for now you'd better concentrate on molehills. Be conservative now and tackle the mountains later!",
"Organized parties, impromptu get-togethers, or other social events should be enjoyable today, Capricorn. You will feel a strong sense of belonging to a family or community and a rush of affection for everyone involved. No matter what you think you have to do, don't turn down an invitation. What you gain from being with others is more important than anything else right now.",
"Your inspiration and imagination are at their peak, Capricorn. You may want to try some kind of an artistic project. You're sure to be pleasantly surprised by the results. You're especially tuned in to the feelings of others, so don't hesitate to act on your intuition. Logic takes a back seat to gut instinct today!",
"This morning, Capricorn, you could see nothing but piles of papers that you have no use for. You might go through them like a house afire, wanting to clear out as much clutter as you can. This is always good. A cluttered house parallels a cluttered mind. However, make certain you at least scan each thing before you discard it. You don't want to throw something out you may need later.",
"Today a friendship could develop into something more, Capricorn. Someone you know fairly well but never thought of as a potential lover could suddenly show a romantic interest in you and you could respond. Whether or not you choose to do anything about it depends on you. Circumstances and people change. Think twice before you dismiss this person. Don't do it because they're \"just\" a friend.",
"Today you may feel a little out of sorts, Capricorn, but your creative energies are likely to flow freely. Inspiration could come from deep within you. You're probably more focused than usual, and therefore can spend considerable time working on a task or project without getting restless. Give free rein to your ideas. They might seem a bit dark and strange at first, but they're important.",
"There's a big world out there beckoning to you, Capricorn. Why not plan an adventure to a faraway land? You've been working hard and deserve a reward. If you can't take time off right now, at least contact a travel agent or do some research online. Surround yourself with pamphlets and images of foreign cities. Even though you know you can't travel to them now, you know you will get there soon.",
"Don't trust anything related to money or contracts today, Capricorn. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of contract, whether it's starting an investment program, negotiating a salary, or changing banks. There's a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding in the air. You may think you understand what you're signing, but you may not. Save legal and financial matters for another day.",
"You might contemplate a change of residence, or at least a change in household. Someone could move out or move in. Travel might be on your mind. You could decide to plan a trip by air either out of state or out of the country. These changes imply expansion not only in your worldly life but also within. Go with the flow.",
"A number of new and exciting relationships could appear in your life now, some of them showing promise of becoming close. Old ones seem to be fading. This can make you a little sad, Capricorn, but it's a process that you can't stop. As you change inside, so your relationships change. You might attract friends who share new interests. Go with the flow.",
"You may be excited about an idea today, Capricorn, but unfortunately no one else may be. You spring up with enthusiasm only to smack into a brick wall. One side of you may be communicative and witty while the other is confused. The two sides aren't really connecting well, so perhaps you should just lay low. Hold on to your ideas, and save their presentation for a later day.",
"You're apt to feel stronger within, helping you to connect the inner and outer sides of your personality, Capricorn. You may feel like you have all your troops united on a common front and are making tremendous progress toward reaching your goals. Don't stop. Your momentum is strong. Things you set in motion now will have a tremendous effect that will continue to increase over time.",
"An intellectual problem may prove confusing, Capricorn, and reading and research reveal contradictory information. You might also hear some gossip that doesn't seem quite right. This isn't the day to believe everything you read or hear or to try to make sense of anything that has you befuddled. You will be in a better space later. Put it aside for a few days and then tackle it.",
"Your mind is strong and focused today, Capricorn. As a result, you're probably feeling especially physically robust. Sudden insights could earn you some satisfying acknowledgement, not to mention the respect of someone important to you. Your intuition level is high and apt to serve you well now, particularly where work and health are concerned. Make the most of it!",
"It might seem like your brain and heart are working against you today, Capricorn. You might sense that they've teamed up to keep your head in a swirling maelstrom of confusion that you can't seem to pull out of. Look beyond the mundane confusion of this day. Connect with your sensitive, receptive side, sit back, and let someone else do the thinking.",
"Recent conflicts may stir up some anger in you, Capricorn. This is a powerful force, and you could be tempted to get into a big fight. Put the weapons away and bring out the olive branch. Take that energy that has built up and use it to fuel your romantic affairs instead of warlike ventures. Defuse the situation by sharing passionate nights with the one you love.",
"An element of the mystical and fanciful will play a significant part in your world today, Capricorn. This energy is likely to come to you unexpectedly, and your first reaction might be to shy away from it. Believe in the power of thought and intention. Pursue whatever you wish to achieve in your world. Putting a great deal of willpower behind your actions will make you more likely to succeed.",
"Fascinating new information could arrive today from TV or the Internet, opening up new educational opportunities. The possibility of making contact and perhaps visiting new friends in other countries might come to your attention. You will probably find this very exciting, Capricorn, and make plans immediately. This is fine, but be careful to consider all contingencies. Be practical and objective.",
"This is one of those days in which you may ask for five minutes to complete a certain task and an hour later finally finish whatever you set out to do. Keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Things are taking you longer than expected not because you're inefficient but because you're more passionate than usual about what you're doing.",
"You may feel emotionally on fire today, Capricorn. One conversation with someone will suddenly spark a discussion of some sort that proves extremely valuable to you in the long run. Expand your mind. You can learn a great deal by opening yourself up to the truth. Making connections with others will help pave the way toward your success.",
"Financial benefits may come your way through channels you've never dreamed of. This could have to do with investments, settlements, or insurance benefits. Pleasant recurring dreams may come your way, bringing insights to your past and giving rise to new self-awareness. Someone from the past you haven't seen for a long time may suddenly reappear. This should be a pleasant surprise.",
"You're at a creative high point right now, so make sure to nurture this side of your being, Capricorn. It could be that you're in danger of running into an obstacle. Try not to get discouraged. Instead, it may be best for you to reflect on what you've done in the past. Enjoy emotional stability today instead of letting your emotions jump around from one thing to the next.",
"Your emotions could be quite strong today, Capricorn. You may find it difficult to act without having intense feelings come into the picture. Be careful about speaking without first thinking how your words will affect other people. It's important for you to be receptive in order to tune into the activity around you. Be open to others' opinions.",
"Today you might take time out from all the recent excitement to take a good look at your working life, Capricorn. Is it satisfying? Is it contributing not only to your own well-being but also to that of the planet? You're likely to decide to change your profession in some way, either through augmenting the job you have or taking on an entirely new one.",
"You might find your energy comes in strong, erratic bursts today, Capricorn. Don't be surprised if you're high as a kite one moment and down in the dumps the next. Even if you're driving everyone crazy with your yo-yo behavior, don't let this stop you from keeping on in this fashion. You're probably able to keep very good track of the dozens of things going on around you.",
"It's important to turn your attention to more spiritual matters now, Capricorn. Consider enrolling in a yoga class that combines meditation with the physical practice. It's vital to link your mind, body, and soul together. The more you can integrate these three parts of your being, the healthier you will feel. A high-energy dance class would also be a good way to achieve this goal.",
"Luck and prosperity lie within your grasp now, Capricorn. The only problem is that you might not notice because you're so caught up in some emotional drama that occupies your entire being. Don't concern yourself with issues that don't directly pertain to you. Your time and energy are too precious. Keep your mind focused on your biggest goals.",
"Some time alone with a special person is definitely called for today, Capricorn. The social whirl of recent weeks has put you in touch with a lot of old friends and enabled you to make new ones. Now it's time to relax at home. You might discuss your plans for your future together, perhaps regarding possible changes in your living situation. You might also give some thought to your career.",
"You could either be planning or preparing for a long journey by air, Capricorn. Your plans may still need to be confirmed. Today is the perfect day to do this. Spiritual matters might be very much on your mind right now, and you might read a lot about such subjects. Don't be surprised if it proves difficult to put them out of your mind.",
"A social event could put you in contact with people who love to gossip, Capricorn. They might have some juicy tidbits to report, and you could be torn between curiosity and compassion for the person being discussed. If what you hear is good, relax and enjoy it. If it's vicious, don't be afraid to speak up. Someone has to express displeasure at the spreading of unkind rumors!",
"If you're a salesperson, Capricorn, expect orders to roll in today. You're unusually persuasive, making it virtually impossible for anyone to say no to you. All signs indicate you will be successful with whatever you undertake. Take advantage of this auspicious time. But be wary if you end up on the receiving end of a sales pitch. Opportunities that seem too good to be true usually are.",
"This morning you may wake up from a dream with many inspiring new ideas. If you're into creative activity of any kind, you will want to jot these ideas down, as well as possibilities for bringing them to the rest of the world. This could be through music, painting, writing, or any kind of art form. Don't be surprised if your style changes a little. If nothing else, this demonstrates versatility!",
"Today you're going to want to shut out the world and be alone with your thoughts, Capricorn. You're caught up in the introspective energies at play. You may not be very cooperative, and may even wish to spend time on more solitary activities. Indulge yourself. You might want to take time alone to meditate. Listen to yourself. You're likely to be on the verge of a major self-discovery.",
"You could feel a bit low today due to disappointment in someone important to you, Capricorn. It could be that a mentor no longer supports you or perhaps an authority figure has shown his or her true colors. Rather than casting about for a new role model, why not follow the path that you know is right for you? You're experienced enough now not to need anyone else to lead the way.",
"You may feel a little under the weather today, Capricorn. You may even develop sniffles or a sore throat. If so, consider going to the doctor. This can be an especially unwelcome development, as it keeps you from certain activities. If you act quickly, your ailment may not worsen. Take the time you need to feel healthy again before returning to your routine.",
"Whether you spend today with your feet on the ground or in an airplane, you're eager and enthusiastic about your life direction. If you aren't on your way to a distant land, it's likely that you will be airborne soon, Capricorn. You've achieved tremendous success lately and that trend is going to continue. If this trip is a reward to yourself for all of your hard work, you deserve it!",
"Spiritual studies might seem fascinating and confusing, Capricorn. Are you reading a book whose author isn't clear? Perhaps this isn't the best work to bring you the information you seek. Ask friends to recommend better books. Make a trip to the library. See what's available online. There's no need to try to make sense of something that's confusing to begin with.",
"What's driving you today, Capricorn? Why do you feel an obsessive need to get all your work done at once? If you're trying to impress someone, there's no need. Others already hold you in high regard. If the project you're working on is urgent, get some help. Don't try to do it all yourself unless you want to be too stressed out to accomplish anything tomorrow. Talk about counterproductive!",
"Be quick to point out when you see an injustice, Capricorn. If someone says something offensive or untrue, don't let it slide. If you do, you're just as much at fault as the person who committed the offense. When you know you're right, say so. It's important that others respect you. Your honest nature and good moral sense are important qualities and should be recognized accordingly.",
"Being married to someone for many years takes work, Capricorn. No one said it was going to be easy. Hollywood promotes a fantasyland that can make your life look drab and boring by comparison. Realize that your life can be good and interesting, too - reality is even better than the movie version. Today is a good day to prepare for future growth.",
"There's an Earthy weightiness to today. You could feel like your relationships are in a difficult situation, Capricorn. Don't worry, because the clouds are going to lighten up tremendously after today. Put in your hard work now and do any last minute planning you feel is necessary before you're off and running. The starting gate is about to open.",
"Ground yourself today, Capricorn. Lay a solid foundation for the future. This is a very critical time in which you must think realistically about your future success. You must incorporate an element of restriction into your life before your dreams can actualize. Today is one of those days in which you can fuse a powerful combination of fantasy and reality in order to build success.",
"Too many people may be vying for your attention today, Capricorn, both at work and home. You will want to make them all happy, so you may feel a little frazzled. Your temper might also be on edge. It would be better to put off the less urgent demands than work yourself into a frenzy. Those who matter would rather have you enjoy life than tire yourself out for their sake.",
"Your life certainly seems to revolve around human contact. You're an outgoing, cheerful, engaging conversationalist who enjoys bringing people together, though lately you've been yearning to be alone. Capricorn, don't ignore any urge you feel for solitude. Even though it's an unusual need for you, it's still a valid one.",
"You're radiant and glowing with happiness today. This is a refreshing change after the gloom and doom of the past few weeks. Apparently the decisions you made worked out for the best. Or, even better, perhaps you're in love? In any case, Capricorn, it will be even easier than usual for you to communicate with others and share your joy. Let the good times roll!",
"Much of your day is likely to be spent in the company of family, close friends, and a current or potential love partner, Capricorn. Business partners could be involved. This should be a very pleasant, stimulating day for you. People you care about and enjoy will surround you. You're also likely to become more strongly bonded to a romantic partner.",
"A new or long-term romantic relationship could be advanced to the next level of commitment, Capricorn. The chemistry between you is strong and you're compatible on several levels. Today you will experience passion like never before! Some intense but honest and very positive discussion about the relationship's future is likely to take place, followed by an intimate encounter.",
"Career changes may be on the horizon, Capricorn. Although positive in the long run, the events leading up to the change may seem catastrophic. Your employer could go out of business or move too far away for you to commute. The secret here is not to panic. Accept the situation and move on. In the end, you will probably be glad that this happened. Success and good fortune are coming.",
"You may need to take the day off to replenish your soul, Capricorn. You've been working exceptionally hard lately. While your output is impressive, it's coming at a high personal cost. Take some time today to let your mind and body rest and relax. Cuddle up in your favorite chair with a book, some tea, and a quilt. Let your mind wander. You may be surprised where it lands.",
"Friends and money rarely mix, Capricorn. Today a close friend may ask for a loan. Think carefully. Rather than take the easy route and say yes, you and your friend would be better served if you helped him or her figure out a way to earn the money. Perhaps you could offer a job or introduce your friend to someone else who can help. Be creative and you will find a solution that works for everyone.",
"Spiritual and metaphysical concepts may seem murky to you today, Capricorn. Ideas that friends accept as matters of course might feel strange. Don't get into an argument. Ask about books, websites, or magazines that you can consult for more input and, hopefully, clarity. Find out about future lectures on the subject. It should all come together eventually. You just need to be patient!",
"You might not be in the mood to cooperate today, Capricorn. You will most likely want to work on projects alone at your own pace. You will probably have to come out of your shell and interact with others. You may need advice or input. Try not to be too pouty with your partner or kids. They might not understand the real reason why you're distracted.",
"Are you contemplating a trip, Capricorn, perhaps to a place you've always dreamed of visiting? If you're in doubt as to whether or not you can do it, work out your budget and you might be surprised. Invite a friend or romantic partner to accompany you. Such a trip could boost your personal growth like nothing you've ever tried before. Think about it!",
"A rather spacey friend or acquaintance from far away could call today, Capricorn, perhaps to propose a visit. This might not be convenient now, and could put you in a quandary as to whether or not to agree to it. Your decision eventually comes down to how much you care for this person and how badly you want to see him or her. Think carefully before saying yes or no.",
"A temporary separation from a romantic partner might have you despairing today, Capricorn. Your imagination may conjure up all sorts of dreadful scenarios, like your beloved finding someone else. Don't do this to yourself. Your friend probably misses you, too. Keep busy so the days pass quickly until your friend comes back and you're together again. Be patient!",
"Try not to do everything all at once today, Capricorn. Your social life is heating up and you may be in a frenzy preparing for all the gatherings you've been invited to. All this on top of your regular workload could send you into a tailspin. Pace yourself. Get your work done first before thinking about your social life. Remember, if you were unemployed, you wouldn't be able to go out at all!",
"You feel energetic and optimistic, Capricorn. You can do anything you set your mind to! This positive outlook is a refreshing change from the usual pessimism. It's certainly easier to go through life happy. As someone once said, people pretty much choose whether or not they're going to be happy. Kudos to you for making the right choice. You're bound to be successful once you believe you can be.",
"You feel like you have a stone strapped to your back, Capricorn. The farther you walk with this load, the slower you go, and the more hunched over you will be by the time you reach your destination. Unloaded the stone from your pack. Realize that this break in your journey will help you make much better time in the long run and save you from a great deal of physical strain.",
"You're an avid reader, Capricorn. Today you may come across some ideas that inspire ideas of your own. Perhaps you read something gives you an idea for a short story. Maybe an interview with a famous musician reignites your desire to play the piano. Pay attention to these yearnings. Write them down. When you review them in a few days, you will see which ones still have a strong pull on you.",
"The temptation to take center stage might be too strong to resist, Capricorn. Someone may ask you to tell a story. Your gift with words and vivid imagination should serve you well. Keep it brief. If you go on too long, your friends could fidget. Time your performance by watching their expressions. Do it right and you will be asked to do it again.",
"You have a wonderful combination of optimism and spirituality, Capricorn. You believe in miracles as well as angels, Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy. We support your attitude wholeheartedly! Today something may happen that only further solidifies your beliefs. Perhaps your guardian angel saves you from stepping in front of a bus, or you receive a telepathic message that stops you from making a bad career mistake.",
"You're unstoppable today, Capricorn. It seems you can do anything. Your confidence and energy are high. There's no question that you're ready to take the world by storm. Is the world ready for you? Think carefully as you formulate plans for your new project. Whatever you do will succeed, but be sure you're doing what you really want to do rather than what others expect of you.",
"You may be looking for some new values in your personal life, Capricorn. You're no longer interested in superficial or frivolous relationships. You need to meet different kinds of people and select friends who are really worth keeping. Don't worry if you feel like taking a step back to get some perspective, because this is the time to do it. Relationships are too important to neglect.",
"The planetary aspects invite you to explore strong expressions of feeling, Capricorn. A declaration of love, autobiography, spiritual confession, apology, or reconciliation. All these kinds of communication bring a kind of intimate revelation. This might be what you need in order to take advantage of the powerful inspiration of the moment.",
"Today is a great time to form or strengthen romantic relationships, Capricorn. If you aren't involved, chances are you will meet someone. If you are, expect your relationship to develop a new spiritual bond. New friendships, particularly with people who share your interests, are on the horizon. The coming years will be a time when everyone will have to pull together. Today you get a head start.",
"You and a current or potential partner may disagree on whether to spend some time together alone or go out with friends, Capricorn. If you've both had a rough day, you're likely to be rather tense and apt to snap at each other. A compromise may be the best answer. Spend an hour or two with your friends and then come home and relax. That way, everyone's happy.",
"The mood will be a bit oppressive today, Capricorn. After meeting the challenges presented by the past several days, you're likely to want a little peace and quiet! But you can expect to be sought out and asked to assume your duties. You may feel like forgetting the whole thing and running away. Be reasonable and wait until you have some vacation time.",
"Your light, breezy spirit may have some trouble harmonizing with today's prevailing mood. Usually when you're cornered, you're able to find a way to squirm to safety. Today you may run out of clever maneuvers. Even though you face the day's challenges alone and unaided, you survive them the same way. Good for you!",
"Here you go again, philosophizing about what personal expression, creation, and authenticity are all about. Have you noticed that you have some problems expressing issues that don't fall within the norm, Capricorn? Your strong will and desire to be appreciated get in your way. It isn't easy to express yourself authentically when you're trying to make an impression on others.",
"People love to be with you because you have such natural charm, Capricorn. But today you may not feel especially charming or like talking to anyone. You may have a secret inside that's screaming to get out. If someone confides in you today, do you think you could confide in him or her, too? You should get an answer to that question today.",
"You may feel living your life is like crossing a desert, but fortunately, Capricorn, today brings your oasis. Take advantage of it! Some people you've met over the past few weeks could turn out to be more interesting than you originally thought. It's up to you to change those parts of your personality that have been holding you back.",
"A lack of time to pursue your spiritual and intellectual interests could weigh on your mind today, Capricorn. Gloom might descend on you, as if responsibilities of the moment are too much for you. Try to be the observer. If a friend came to you for advice with your problem, what would you say? Take your own advice. You might also want to consider streamlining your activities.",
"Working toward goals you share with others could bring you closer together as friends and lovers, Capricorn. The whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts. You're likely to produce better results as a group or partnership than you would have otherwise. This is an \"all pull together\" sort of day. Romantically, you may have an exciting, passionate encounter!",
"Today you might channel one final, powerful burst of energy into completing a goal that means a great deal to you. Your courage and determination are high, and you have the ability to accomplish a lot at this time, Capricorn. If you've been considering projects that others think are impossible, this is the day to act. Move forward with caution, but go for the gold!",
"When faced with an emotionally intense situation, you're likely to flee, Capricorn. You'd rather change the subject to something more lighthearted. This form of escapism is doing nothing to solve the problem. In fact, by avoiding the emotional topic, you're only creating more friction than if you just approached the problem directly.",
"You may end up in some arguments, Capricorn. Your nature is expansive and generous, but if others take advantage of this good nature, your mood quickly turns to anger and detachment. Conflict is often a natural part of a relationship. Use it as a learning experience instead of blowing it out of proportion and turning it into a larger issue than it needs to be.",
"This is a great day to strut your stuff, Capricorn. You're on top of the world, so enjoy it, your family, and the people around you. You're at the forefront of the action and you don't miss a beat, regardless of the conversation buzzing around you. You're able to whip out facts and dates at the drop of a hat. Don't let anyone bring you down or talk you out of your good mood.",
"Today you might be with friends who want to go out on the town and spend money. Shopping, eating in fancy restaurants, or going to dance clubs could be in their plans. This is fine, Capricorn, as long as you don't get caught up in the excess. Find a happy medium between spending too much and acting like a party pooper.",
"You may feel that your current relationships are more complicated than ever, Capricorn. This is because you're going through a period when many planets are trying to shed light on your hidden motivations. When you're finished analyzing and have an understanding of what really drives you, your relationships will seem much simpler.",
"Some past stories may come back to haunt you today, Capricorn. If you once held a government post, for example, a journalist could undercover some error that you made years ago and publish it in today's newspaper! Everyone has to deal with the jealousy of others at some point in their lives. So prepare yourself and fight back!",
"Unsettling news from far away could have you somewhat upset and a little depressed. The temptation to withdraw and brood might seem too strong to resist, but this may not be the best course of action. Getting things done is likely to be the best therapy in emotional situations like this, Capricorn. So if there's a new project you've been considering, this is the day to start it.",
"If you work in a helping profession such as psychotherapy, you're probably breaking quite a few rules and protocols right now, Capricorn. You may even be going against theories that were a fundamental part of your education. Don't be troubled by your rebelliousness. It's important that the status quo be challenged from time to time. It's people like you who advance the field!",
"There are times in your love life when you may feel somewhat inhibited, as though something is holding you back from total fulfillment. Perhaps the emotions overwhelm you or the idea of commitment frightens you. In any case, Capricorn, you're well aware that your reluctance to take the plunge is detrimental to your relationship. The day will call on you to take a few more risks.",
"As a person who loves to experiment with new ideas and discover new people, you will be delighted with the period that is now beginning. Since communication, togetherness, and sociability will rule the next few weeks, it will be a perfect time to get out and show off your gifts. You will have a ball, Capricorn!",
"A delivery that you were expecting from far away might be delayed, Capricorn, causing you to wonder if it might have been lost. It hasn't. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do but wait. Mechanical equipment could also go out of whack, necessitating a call to a repair service. This could set you back some and make you antsy. Try to find something else to do!",
"The Universe is inviting you magnify your vision, Capricorn. It's time to see the bigger, better, more advanced side of things. Remember that life is a mirror. You're highly unlikely to receive more than you hope for. So dream big, hope big, and imagine yourself in the stars. Don't sell yourself short. It's a misuse of humility and modesty.",
"Be careful to not be too cavalier today, Capricorn. It would be wise to adopt a more serious tone than usual. You might be inclined to say words carelessly, but people are going to take you literally. Make sure you mean what you say. Your attention to fashion and pop culture may conflict with a force that's asking you to focus on things of deeper spiritual value.",
"If by chance you have to speak in public soon, Capricorn, trust that people will enjoy listening to you. Words come effortlessly to you, and you exude confidence. You willingly accept the compliments of others. Your energy level is high and you will be unstoppable. This is only fair after all of the work you've put in these last few months!",
"You may be in a difficult position, Capricorn, as a critical part of a pending decision. Your first reaction may be to throw up your hands and leave the decision to someone else. Making a choice is too tough, so you find that you'd rather not have to make it at all. Unfortunately, it looks like everyone else has the same idea. Deep down, you have an opinion that needs to be heard.",
"This could be a highly productive day for you if you approach it in the right way. You will find that you have an added burst of energy that could help you conquer just about any task you set your mind to, Capricorn. You may feel more aggressive than usual, so use this to your advantage by delegating tasks and moving forward on projects that you'd like to see done.",
"The past few weeks may have seemed Earth shattering, Capricorn. You may still be trembling slightly as you head into the coming weeks. Fortunately, the current astral configuration promises to be calmer, although not necessarily less intense. You will be able to apply recent decisions regarding your domestic life and finally settle some important matters.",
"It may be hard for you to maintain your self-discipline, Capricorn. Your childlike nature wants to go out and play. Emotionally, you're anxious to let loose and follow your playful, instinctual nature, yet your sense of responsibility is holding you back. This difficult internal tension may be the cause of irritation in many different areas of your life. Do your best to come to a place of balance and harmony.",
"If something has been bothering you, Capricorn, today is a good time to work it out. Your excellent communicative ability will be even stronger with today's energy. Whether your problems have to do with a colleague, boss, spouse, friend, or relative, you will find the words to effectively communicate your thoughts and feelings. Don't hesitate to make those appointments.",
"When you enter a room, Capricorn, the dynamic suddenly changes. Your presence has a powerful impact on other people. Don't take it lightly. People may hang on your words like they're listening to the queen address to her kingdom. Make sure the content of your speech reflects the gravity of the situation. Make every word count.",
"You are radiant and glowing with happiness today, Capricorn! This is a refreshing change after the gloom of the past few weeks. Apparently, the decisions you made worked out for the best. Or even better, perhaps you're in love? In any case, it will be even easier than usual for you to communicate with others and share your joy. Let the good times roll!",
"Capricorn, you may have recently built fanciful scenarios in your head regarding how you think things should be, in either a romantic, business, or family situation. It's likely these images will conflict with reality as you discover that you need to take a much more analytical approach to what you have going.",
"For you, Capricorn, the next few weeks portend a period of timidity. You will probably go out less, introduce yourself to fewer new people, and be less prone to showing off. But any relationships you do form will be much more intense than usual. The month ahead is quite promising, though you may have to readjust some of your attitudes.",
"It feels like you have more emotional armor on, Capricorn, which will help you deal with a looming battle. Somewhere in your world a conflict is brewing. It may not be obvious, it may not be large, but it's there. Today you're more prepared to deal with things out in the open. You have a larger arsenal of weapons, and your witty, aggressive banter is at a peak.",
"Today is apt to be favorable for you, Capricorn. You should keep the lines of communication open so you can spread your knowledge to others and receive the important information that is due to come your way. Your energy might come in erratic yet powerful bursts. You should find that your ego and emotions are quite strong.",
"You might find that your brain is moving in the slow lane today, Capricorn. It may even be creeping over to the breakdown lane. You might find that it's a bit harder to make your witty rebuttals in conversation. Take your time and make sure you choose your words carefully. Communicating with others might be a bit like pulling teeth.",
"What are you waiting for, Capricorn? Go for the gold. All you need to do is shine. You have the opportunity to merge with powerful groups today, so make sure to keep your eyes open. Do things that will improve your current status in a finance-related situation. Your sharp wit and endless facts and information will come in handy. Have a joke at the ready.",
"The key to being successful today is to maintain an air of stability. If others see you as too flighty and off the wall, they will hesitate about putting their trust in you. Make sure you do those things in your power that will help boost your clout. You will need this support from others later. Make a solid base to build on.",
"You might find that something or someone is purposefully trying to make things difficult for you today, Capricorn. It might seem like you're trying to get a handle on the issues, but somehow things are slipping through your fingers. Don't make any major decisions, and certainly don't try to herd people into corners. Let others have their freedom and consider simply riding out the storm.",
"There's an intensity about the day that may cause you to recoil from certain events and conversations, Capricorn. Issues could get uncomfortable and perhaps a bit too involved. Other people may want to go to places that you don't want to go to. Don't get upset or frustrated. Either join in and roll with the punches or walk away and deal with the issues later.",
"Slow down the pace today, Capricorn. This is a day to sit back and observe and contemplate. Your mind may go in a hundred different directions, and you may be unsure which route to take. Try to quiet the buzzing chatter within. Be receptive to the loving, sensitive forces around you. Try not to disturb the flow by bringing up unrelated issues and hurtful gossip.",
"Today is a good day for you, Capricorn. New opportunities will abound in your regular routine. Work with a group to accomplish something greater than you could do by yourself. Tune in to the energy of the collective. You have exactly the right qualities that others need today. Use them.",
"Today is an excellent day for you, Capricorn. You will receive some bursts of unexpected energy that help you accomplish whatever it is you wish to do. You should enjoy a favorable mood and good relations with others all day. Enjoy yourself and feel free to indulge in things that make you happy. Spend time with your family and let them share in your positive energy flow.",
"Don't waste time today, Capricorn. Act with courage. Tap your primal nature and throw caution to the wind. Your wit and keen mind provide you with opportunities that you should jump on. Link with groups and contribute to projects. Nothing will escape your attention. Enjoy games of wit and puzzles that exercise your brain.",
"One of the themes today is giving versus receiving. You may be asked to handle many tasks at once, something you're naturally quite good at, Capricorn. There's a strong need to take action and get things done, while you may also feel a strong inward pull asking you to settle down and reflect. Both are valid emotions, and both should be honored as you go through your day.",
"You may be a little hesitant today, Capricorn, and not really sure why. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, another aspect comes up with a completely different perspective. It may be hard to choose one path and stick with it. Keep in mind that your unique path may incorporate many different side paths. This is one of your many gifts.",
"There's a certain quality in your personal relationships that motivates you in life, Capricorn. This is one of the reasons why your emotions play an important role in the scheme of things. You're guided by your emotions. Today you will be in the best disposition to meet a lot of people who will give new impetus to your life.",
"You often neglect your health and body. Your equilibrium suffers from this, Capricorn. The time has come to consider a medical checkup just to be on the safe side. You love to discover new things. Your thirst for knowledge incites you to expend a lot of energy. Try to find the time to rest and relax. Avoid all unnecessary effort.",
"You aren't the kind of person who likes to lead an ordinary life. You aren't afraid of the unknown. You like to open up to new worlds and cultures. You sometimes feel willing to change your whole life. Capricorn, to your great satisfaction, today you will probably experience unusual events that could lead your life in new directions.",
"Your emotions may surprise you today as unexpected issues crop up out of nowhere, Capricorn. Take time to smooth the wrinkles in your current plan of attack regarding your involvement with the world. A self-centered approach will create barriers between you and those you wish get near. Consider how your actions affect those you love, and make any necessary adjustments in your approach.",
"Turn your energy inward today, Capricorn. Make a detailed list of what you need to get done in order of priority. It's time to take inventory and get organized. Detail-oriented projects are favored, and you have much more patience and concentration than usual. Slow down the pace and remember to smell the roses as you pass by.",
"Take charge of your life, Capricorn. The more action you take, the more alive you will feel. Maybe you will decide to have a career on the stage. This is the kind of day when you need more variety than usual. Bright and happy people will catch your eye. Jump on the fast track. You're ready.",
"Give special attention to others today, Capricorn. Remind people how much they mean to you. Adopt a childlike attitude of excitement and adventure. This is the name of the game on a day like this. Let the sunshine touch your spirit regardless of the weather. There is extra fuel for your fire. Get out and do the things you love to do.",
"This is a great day for you, Capricorn. There's a terrific feeling of expansion in the air. This is one of those times in which a small germ of an idea can grow into something big right before your eyes. Projects are moving quickly, and information is being rapidly dispersed. Catch the energy and set your dreams in motion. You can accomplish a great deal if you try.",
"Have been letting yourself go lately, Capricorn? Now it's time to take better care of your body. This new initiative will make you feel happier and more ready to tackle life again. You may hesitate over whether or not you should try some of the alternative medicines that you hear about. This is only a small dilemma. Be glad you've finally decided to live a healthier lifestyle.",
"Plans to get some long-neglected tasks done around the house or yard may be interrupted by a phone call from someone dear who lives far away. You might be so excited by the call that you are no longer in the right frame of mind to finish your work once the conversation ends. Don't worry. You can always get the tasks done later.",
"Brusque words or a lack of cordiality from a friend or colleague might have you wondering if this person is angry with you, Capricorn. Don't let your insecurity make you crazy. This person probably just has problems of their own on their mind. Do your best not to take any stinging comments seriously. Have a little faith and show a little compassion.",
"Your sharp intuition and imagination could bring enlightening spiritual insights, Capricorn. Metaphysical or religious books could be especially appealing. Relations with close friends and family should benefit from this enhanced sensitivity. You may be able to understand them better because of it. This could be inspiring. It might move you to write or start some other creative activity.",
"Today you might be waiting for a letter or call from a close friend or love partner, Capricorn. Its delay could cause a powerful feeling of gloom. Don't let it spoil your day. The communication will come, and if not today, then within a few days. Meanwhile, this is a great time to try your hand at writing or music. Be creative while you wait. You might also call another friend.",
"Recent spiritual breakthroughs might have you feeling both exhilarated and downcast, Capricorn. Your sensitive side tells you that this is a definite step forward on your spiritual path, but the logical side might cause you to doubt its reality. Take comfort in the fact that reality is relative and that what you're sensing is at least valid for you. Then keep moving ahead.",
"Trying to get too much work done in the course of the day could prove self-defeating, Capricorn. Your energy isn't what it usually is, and you're probably operating on adrenaline. Consider the situation carefully and list your tasks in order of urgency. The world won't come to an end if you don't get them all done by the end of the day. In the evening, watch a movie and order a pizza.",
"Uptight is the mood for today. You might be the center of attention at some point. While you normally wouldn't mind, Capricorn, today it might make you nervous. When everyone looks at you and expects you to say something, say it. Keep it short and then withdraw. You aren't in the mood. Walk to the library and throw yourself into reading about subjects that interest you. This should relieve the stress.",
"You may be undecided about a loved one today, Capricorn. Something may urge you to act yet you want to lay low. There's an important next step that you must take now. Carefully think the situation through before you make a move. In fact, this day would best be spent gathering data on the issue. It seems you should wait a bit before actually doing anything about it.",
"An increased understanding of different cultures as well as curiosity about the people who live there might spur you to learn more about those places. Friends or groups could be involved in some way. You may channel a lot of energy into intellectual activities and inspire others to do the same. Take a walk at some point during the day. You will need to clear your head.",
"Today is a good day to simply get things done, Capricorn. Take care of the annoying tasks that have been accumulating. You have a great opportunity to accomplish a lot. People are less concerned with frivolous drivel and gossip than they are with setting a plan to meet an important goal. Contribute to this trend by getting serious about the tasks at hand.",
"As you follow the path toward acquiring the latest, greatest, fastest, and best, you may have left behind some fundamental values, Capricorn. Don't lose sight of the principles that make up your foundation. You could be shaken today when your ego goes on trial for pig-headed behavior. Stay in check and be conscious of the way you project yourself to others.",
"There may be dreaminess about your emotions today, Capricorn, which could keep you from focusing on the task at hand. The aspects dictate that people may be stubborn and confused - and you're likely to be one of them. Your mind may seem to be going in two different directions and you aren't sure which way to proceed. Try to incorporate more of your dreams into your waking reality.",
"Your physical stamina is apt to be strong today, Capricorn. You should consider going to the gym to release some of that pent-up energy. Engage in team sports or something that involves strategy and good coordination. Pick up a tennis racquet or join a basketball game. Your high energy will be the key to coming out on top.",
"Get up and get going today, Capricorn. You have no time to lose. Your mind will be busy tackling many tasks, but this suits you just fine. You're well equipped to deal with the many frantic situations that are likely to come up. There's a great deal of strength to your emotions that you can use to connect with others and communicate your thoughts in a healthy manner.",
"You may say one thing one minute and the opposite the next, Capricorn. Most of the time you jump from one issue to the next with no hassle, but today people probably will call you on it. Think about what you mean before you say it. Don't do all your thinking aloud so others can hear. Your continuous thought process might be mistaken for your final analysis. Confusion could ensue.",
"Your mind may seem rather cloudy today, Capricorn, but don't let this hinder you. In fact, you can use this dreamy feeling to your advantage. Try to bring more magic into your life. The more you accept your bizarre feelings and ideas, the more things will fall into place. Don't think that everything in life has to be completely rational.",
"Listen closely to the wind, for the answers are blowing right in front of you, Capricorn. Make contact with people you haven't heard from in a while. You can be quite productive today in unexpected situations. Ironically, the less you plan, the more you will accomplish. Be spontaneous. Revelations will come to you in a flash.",
"This is an important day to make valuable connections, Capricorn. You will be engaged in fast-paced, witty conversations and debates from which you can learn a great deal. You're good at seeing both sides of an issue. The problem is that this can lead to indecisiveness and an inability to commit. Choose a path and stick to it.",
"People may be a bit critical of you today, Capricorn. You would do well to listen to what they say. Be receptive of feedback so you can establish a healthy ego. Keep your sense of humility. You may feel critical as you see people moving like sloths compared to your lightning quick mind. Be patient with others.",
"The doldrums are over and it's time to pick up the pace, Capricorn. Come out of your house in full regalia today. Be proud of what you have to offer to the world. Be courageous in your dealings with others. Take the time to express yourself fully in a creative manner. The bigger the smile you wear, the further you will go in just about every situation.",
"Be open to any invitations that come your way or any new people you meet. Change is in the air for you, Capricorn, and you need only be receptive in order for it to come about. You may even meet someone at a social event who winds up being your partner for life. Explore all your interests and trust your intuition, for it will be a reliable guide.",
"Any expansive feeling you experience may be rained on today. You could get the feeling that you've lost touch with reality. Make sure you connect with real life, Capricorn, and do a bit of planning to balance your whimsical side. Things that you haven't accounted for might crop up to serve as a reminder that you need to deal with real life.",
"There are several opportunities open now that weren't there before. The key is to take advantage of them. Find freedom in the strange and new. Be a pioneer today and venture into the unknown. This is a day to expand and reach new heights by having more confidence in your abilities. Things will get stale and boring if you keep doing the same things over and over.",
"Jump into action with energy today, Capricorn. Order others around and delegate tasks for a change. An aggressive approach is what's needed, and you have the ability to deliver the goods. Trying to do everything yourself may seem like a great idea at first, but you're better off enlisting help so others can feel more involved and you can concentrate on doing a better job on fewer tasks.",
"A possible change in direction might arise today. You could meet someone new or run into someone you haven't seen in a while who offers you a chance to change careers. Or it could become clear that you need to pursue your art or hobby full time. Whichever it is, Capricorn, this is a great day to pursue it, even if you have doubts. Your past accomplishments afford you an advantage.",
"You may have had a tendency to go about your daily routine lethargically lately, Capricorn. But today the alarm clock wakes you up. You may understand that your help is urgently needed and there's no time to waste. You can expect to pour a great deal of energy into a single, well-defined goal. If you usually wander from project to project, this will be a change for you.",
"This may be a climactic day for you, Capricorn, especially when it comes to your emotions. You could find that people try to wield some sort of power over you. Maybe they're trying to throw their weight around to get you to do something. Don't be manipulated. Stand up for yourself and be strong.",
"This will be an interesting day provided you keep your eyes and ears open to the opportunities that arise. Don't be afraid to take on new challenges. Even if you feel unsure about your abilities, embrace the chance to test them. If others think you're up to the challenge, you should give yourself the same benefit of the doubt! New friends are indicated - make a point to smile.",
"You may think that everything is perfect, Capricorn, when suddenly, there's a great surge of unyielding emotional energy. Be on the lookout because such situations are likely to crop up and add intensity to your journey. Pool your knowledge with that of other people instead of trying to come up with all the answers by yourself.",
"This should be a fun day for you, Capricorn. You should enjoy a good mood and social times with others. Don't do anything that requires discipline or realistic thinking. This is a better day to simply have fun and relax. If you must work, do your best to keep your mood up. You can have fun even if you're being productive with menial tasks and duties.",
"Connect with people on a deep level, Capricorn. Much of your focus is on emotional security. Make sure your home is a sanctuary where you feel comfortable being exactly who you are. Demonstrate patience and understanding through your words and actions. The more solid and steady you are, the more you will do and the more you will connect with the people around you.",
"You may need to use charm and wit to ease a tense situation, Capricorn. Gridlock could be making you feel uncomfortable. Your solution to the problem is to put on a happy face and divert attention from the difficulty by telling some jokes. Realize that this technique will delay having to face a particular situation for a while, but it certainly won't keep you from ever having to deal with it.",
"Things should be going well for you, Capricorn. Stay on track and you'll have a clear runway. If you deviate from where you need to be, you might get a harsh reminder from something or someone. There are powerful forces at work. You'll benefit if you work with instead of against them. Maintain your focus on the truth and those aspects that align with your soul.",
"This is a whirlwind day for you. You will finally feel like you're getting things back on track, Capricorn. Any lag you've felt in the past few days will be eliminated. Your engine is in high gear. You have more of a sense of what you want. Don't be so concerned with how you're going to get it. Focus more on defining it precisely.",
"Your thoughts may be strained, Capricorn, and you could find it difficult to process things that are normally no problem. Try not to force answers that don't seem to want to come. If the information flows easily and smoothly, you will know that it's meant for you. If you have to pull teeth in order to get at the truth, you may need to back off.",
"You're likely to be even quicker on the uptake than usual, Capricorn. Conversation will be brisk and lively. You may feel like the conductor of a symphony. You're able to understand and follow all the different harmonies and melody lines while keeping your own steady beat running through your head. The music you make with others will be magical.",
"Maintain your integrity, Capricorn. Other people may suspect your motives, so make sure you give them no reason to doubt you. Be confident in your actions and follow through with your promises. There's a great deal of power under your belt, but it's erratic. Take breaks during the day to collect your energy and refocus.",
"Your ability to juggle many tasks is going to come in handy, Capricorn. Information may fly and you could be asked to step up and contribute your wealth of knowledge. You may come into opposition with someone with a superior attitude. Remember that the old ways aren't always best. They may have worked in the past, but things have changed.",
"You're in the hot seat today, Capricorn. Other people might put you on the spot for no apparent reason. This uncomfortable feeling could lead to tension if you overreact. Be careful that you have all the facts on the issue before you react. The whole situation may be a big misunderstanding. Maintain a level head tempered with kindness and respect.",
"What a perfect day to go to a spa, get a massage, or enjoy a sauna, Capricorn. You've accumulated a lot of tension and stress lately, and you may have had a hard time trying to calm down. You need some peace and quiet. Don't even pick up a newspaper. Try not to even think! Just tune out and take care of yourself.",
"Today you won't feel quite like your usual upbeat self, Capricorn. There's nothing to be concerned about. It's just that you have a lot to do and can't help but be focused on it. You certainly are conscientious! See if you can't get out for some fun after you've finished your tasks. You've earned a break.",
"You may have received some bad news concerning your finances, Capricorn. This is probably the best day you could ask for out of the whole month to deal with these problems. If you want to come out of this situation a winner, it may be necessary to approach things from a different angle than usual. Rest assured that things will probably work out just fine.",
"It's possible that you're feeling obliged to do something out of a sense of duty toward family or loved ones, Capricorn. Take this time to help someone who's struggling with who they are and what they're doing in this world. Your concern for others reflects a noble sense of empathy that you should develop more regularly. We're only as strong as the weakest link. Do your part to strengthen the chain.",
"Things go well in your love life today, Capricorn, but only if you let them happen. You must first open your arms to give and receive. If your arms are full of laundry, it will be harder for people to hug you. Take your clothes to the cleaners and keep your arms free to receive the love you need. Remember that giving is as important as receiving.",
"Are you taking a long-distance trip by air, Capricorn? Postpone it if you can. It might end up being slow and tedious. If you must travel, be prepared for delays, lost luggage, or bad weather. Travel light, be at the airport early, and take some reading material. If you're planning a trip, don't confirm the arrangements or the same effects might apply when you do travel. Wait a few days.",
"Money worries may plague you today, Capricorn. There might not be any real reason. You may just be fretting over possible troubles that could come up. This is a pointless exercise. Cross that bridge when you come to it. Take steps to avoid this contingency if you wish, but don't waste time worrying. The stress isn't worth it.",
"You should pay attention to your dreams, Capricorn, but tonight your subconscious might send you some garbled information that means next to nothing. If the message is obvious, pay attention to it, but if you have to perform too many mental gymnastics to discern what the symbols mean, they might mean nothing. Sometimes a dream is just a dream.",
"Your desire to advance your education and learn new skills could be promoted by a sudden event that points you in the right direction, Capricorn. You could start training an artistic talent or learn to use new technology or find out about the latest advances in scientific knowledge. Your mind is sharp and curiosity high. The opportunity to learn will appear.",
"You should be feeling especially passionate at this time, Capricorn, especially regarding partnerships. Romantic partnerships definitely call for an evening together! Professional and creative partnerships call for a new project that you believe in strongly. Look to events in other states or foreign countries for inspiration. Something begun in places far away could capture your imagination.",
"Today you may substitute chocolate for a lack of love because you feel tempted to treat yourself to something good. This is fine, but confine yourself to a small amount. Overindulgence in sweets could have you regretting it when you get a stomachache, not to mention step on the scale! Remember, moderation is the key.",
"Delays in accomplishing certain goals could have you feeling down today, Capricorn. You could wonder if you did something wrong. Chances are you didn't. The delays probably stem from poor communication. Letters, emails, and other messages might not have been delivered in a timely manner. Hang in there and continue to believe in yourself.",
"Make sure you have an equal amount of give and take in your life, Capricorn. If someone gives you a compliment today, know how to receive it graciously instead of brushing it off as something meaningless. At the same time, be generous with your compliments to others. It costs you nothing and it's worth a treasure chest of gold. How can you beat a deal like that?",
"Your ESP continues to expand, Capricorn, and you sense what friends are feeling without their saying anything. Don't be surprised if one is hiding some repressed anger! The chance to travel may come up unexpectedly, and you could be in a quandary about going. Consider it carefully. If it's feasible, go for it. This isn't the time to hold back.",
"The engagements in your social calendar are likely stacking up to the point of absurdity, Capricorn. Make sure you schedule some time for yourself somewhere in there. Today you're choosy about your companions. Feel free to say no to people you'd simply rather not see.",
"You may be coming to a point of reckoning in something you set into motion years ago, Capricorn. This is a time of hard work when you may need to either salvage the mess you've created or start reaping the wonderful rewards of the success you've become. Your ego is wrapped up in this scenario. You may be frustrated by people wasting your time with problems that seem insignificant.",
"Tap into your creativity to unblock your emotions today, Capricorn. This can be a more powerful tool than you realize. Creativity is a big part of you - almost as big as communication. Your emotions are linked to these, and all are interacting beneath the surface. If one is blocked, the key to releasing it is to focus on the other two. Express yourself through creativity and talking to someone close.",
"Venturing into something completely new and different may be what you need, Capricorn. You have a solid practical side, but the need for excitement and adventure is likely just as strong. If you've been putting your nose to the grindstone a lot lately, take time off for some fun. Visit a friend or drive to a place you haven't been to before and explore.",
"You're at an emotionally climactic time, Capricorn. You may feel like someone is putting a damper on your feelings. Perhaps you're scared or shy. Perhaps you don't feel you can express yourself the way you want to. If so, consider why. Do other people make you feel this way or are you uncomfortable with your own feelings? The issue may have more to do with your inner turmoil than with others.",
"Consider talking with a good friend today, Capricorn. Don't let your pride get in the way of getting the support and help you need. If you've made a mistake or fear you've done something wrong, don't walk around with guilt. Sit down with a confidante over a cup of coffee and share what's happening. Remember that everyone ends up in positions like this at some time.",
"A warm, loving letter, phone call, or email could come today from someone dear who lives far away. This should be delightful, Capricorn, but the frustrations that result from the separation could cause you to think about taking a trip to visit the person. This might be a good idea, but don't make any promises. Wait a few days and look into the possibility to see if it's workable.",
"Start your day writing in a journal, Capricorn. This provides an avenue to communicate and connect with your inner being. Things you need to do, ambitions, and even challenges can appear while you're writing, providing a map that you can follow. Even if starting is difficult, stick with it. The words will come if you give it a chance. It can make your day much easier.",
"You may watch the clock today, Capricorn. It can be hard to focus on tasks when you're thinking about relaxing, but do your best. You won't get through your tasks any faster if you're unfocused. You might even sabotage what you're doing if you're distracted. You don't want to make more work for yourself than what you started with.",
"This isn't a good day to plan or start a trip by air, Capricorn. Wait a few days if you can. However, if you must confirm plans now, travel light, check all arrangements for accommodation and rental car before you leave, and collect phone numbers for those you intend to meet. Confusion, delays, and misplaced bags could otherwise result. Take a book, music, and chocolate!",
"There's no need to walk around with a frown on a day like this, Capricorn. You have a special spark in your eye and spring in your step that you should make great use of today. Jump into action with vigor and communicate your thoughts to other people. Change is important and necessary now. It might be smart to wipe the slate clean and start anew.",
"Stress and strain could take their toll on you today, Capricorn. Your significant other might be in a foul humor. When the two of you get together, you might want to sit in companionable silence and not say much. Your beloved has had a rough day and is irritated at words and gestures that would be endearing at other times. You may feel a little tense, too. Single? Stay in and indulge in your favorite comforts.",
"A phone call from another state or country could bring some astounding information your way today, Capricorn, awakening you to events and ideas you've never considered before. You might be in a daze for a while. You may want to run this by friends to see what they think. Some interesting discussions could result. By day's end, you won't be thinking the same way!",
"Kick up your heels and get moving, Capricorn. The fast-paced energy of the day is just what you need to get things done. You're ready to take action. You have power and strength behind you, so feel free to expand and explore this desire to conquer. New adventures are on the horizon now and you have a great opportunity to take advantage of situations that resonate with your true self.",
"This is a tremendous day for you, Capricorn. You may find that dreams really can come true. Make sure you stay abreast of communication and periodicals. Let your fingers dip into many different pies and keep a notepad handy. Your brilliant strokes of inspiration may come on a whim, so be ready to receive them. The genius within you yearns to spring forth.",
"Squabbles may break out among members of your group, Capricorn. You might wonder what the big deal is since what they're arguing over seems rather silly. Apparently it's important to them! If you feel up to it, get your friends out of their emotional chaos and view the subject more objectively. It might not calm them down, but at least you'll have done something!",
"You receive some new insight about an important person in your life, Capricorn, and your relationship takes a dramatic turn for the better. You feel you now know this person completely, and your closeness borders on the profound. This new alliance could also have positive repercussions on your finances.",
"You feel as though you've turned a financial and professional corner, Capricorn. Recent accomplishments have you feeling energized and on top of the world! You exude confidence. It's a good feeling, isn't it? Members of the opposite sex are especially attracted to you right now. And who could blame them? You're looking great!",
"Stress could have you feeling a little out of sorts by the end of the day, Capricorn. You might have been considering going out for the evening, but it might be better if you put off those plans and stay home and rest. Take a walk to a takeout place and get some dinner, then relax with a funny video. This way you'll able to release all the tension and sleep soundly.",
"Today you might be so intent on your work that you don't hear what someone says to you, Capricorn. No matter how important your task, take the time to listen and pay attention to what someone tells you, however trivial it may seem now. It might not matter in the end, but it's best to err on the side of caution. Sparing a few minutes now could avoid a serious rift in a friendship.",
"Today, Capricorn, you may feel out of sorts. You probably aren't ill, but you may be tired. You could also suffer from vague aches and pains that are most likely related to stress. Take the day off and relax. Soak in a tub and read a book. Your imagination is working overtime and you need to get your mind off your malaise. Fantasy novels may be your best bet!",
"This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn, so make the most of every moment. You can accomplish a tremendous amount as you juggle a dozen different things at once. Others will be inspired by your miraculous feats. You're a superstar! While you hold everyone in thrall, take the opportunity to send your love and generosity outward. It will be cherished.",
"Today you should feel excited and enthusiastic about life in general, Capricorn. Your mind might jump from possible creative projects to philosophy, travel, distant places, and you may consider all of them to be the focus of potential future activities. Romance could also be on your mind, but not in an obsessive way. Entertain yourself in a lighthearted manner.",
"A welcome letter, phone call, or perhaps visit could come from a lover or close friend bringing interesting news. Your creative energies are bubbling over, Capricorn, so you might want to try writing, music, drawing, or painting. You might send some letters, place a lot of phone calls, or make a lot of short trips in your neighborhood, maybe to libraries or bookstores.",
"The Rolling Stones said it best, \"I can't get no satisfaction,\" and that's how you've been feeling lately, Capricorn. Indeed, looking back on your recent activities, you may feel a bit like a character in Wonderland - running as fast as you can just to stay in the same place. The day ahead will provide some relief and open up new, more fulfilling opportunities.",
"Make sure you aren't projecting a picture of yourself that doesn't represent the real you, Capricorn. It's important that you remain true to your soul or you'll end up in situations that make you uncomfortable and frustrated. There's a strong transformative force working against you today, but you'll have the leadership and confidence to stand up for yourself in whatever way you need.",
"You may try to explain something with your brain today when the true understanding of the situation comes only through your heart, Capricorn. Feel the answer from deep within instead of trying to decipher it. Sink into the mood of the environment instead of trying to break it down into little compartments that you can analyze and categorize. Consider the whole instead of the pieces.",
"Interest in art from distant lands might capture your interest today, possibly through the influence of friends. Your desire to travel may be awakened, and you might toy with the idea of visiting faraway places, perhaps in the company of a lover. If you're serious, start doing research. This is a great day to plan a vacation.",
"Have you been putting off some work? It may be weighing on your mind. You could work extra hard today to get it out of the way. Afterward you'll feel relieved, but don't push yourself too hard or you won't have any energy left for tomorrow. If some of the tasks don't get done, that's OK. They've waited this long, so another day won't hurt.",
"Are you currently involved in a creative enterprise with a partner? If so, expect a burst of energy to be directed to completing that project. You might make more progress today than you have in several weeks, though you may be surprised at the direction the enterprise takes. In the evening, schedule a date with a love partner. You'll have a lot to report!",
"Your words have tremendous impact today, so think before you speak. It's easy to hurt others' feelings if you don't take them into account. Try to be careful in any phone conversation and always verify that you've made yourself clear, especially when giving directions. Go deeper today instead of just floating about on the surface. People will open up to you.",
"You can overcome difficulties with business and money through the help of someone older. Helpful advice makes a future course of action seem clearer and more practical than before. Your practical abilities are heightened. You're less likely than usual to let strong emotions interfere with using them. A previously unused intuitive ability could also help you now.",
"Communication with business and romantic partners should be more warm, open, and honest than usual. Take advantage of this to get misunderstandings out of the way, explain things that might seem confusing, and develop empathy with those around you. You could come out of this more united in all of your relationships.",
"Get things started. You have many fantastic ideas. Really, the hardest thing for you now is to choose which one to pursue first. Activities that engage your creativity and sensitivity are most appealing now. Give some strength to your heart, which is normally seen as being tender and overly sensitive. Know that you're brave and go for the gold.",
"You'll be at an advantage if you can learn to distance yourself from the emotional crux of the matter. Maintain a neutral viewpoint. It will be important in order for you to conduct yourself in the way you need to in order to be successful. Great flashes of inspiration result as long as you can keep your mental processes running smoothly.",
"This is a very opportune day for you. Say hello to the stranger in line or follow through on a tip or comment. Opportunities are there. All you have to do is grab them. You'd do very well in a group situation today. In fact, you'd do well leading others. You understand the need for action. Be decisive and confident.",
"If you've wanted to take a class in astrology, science, or computers, it's time to sign up. If you're already taking such a class, expect a fascinating, stimulating discussion in connection with it. Make sure you take notes, as you won't want to forget this information as soon as you hear it.",
"Social engagements will be your saving grace. Without them, you may be confused and sad about issues that are reaching a climax. In some form or another, you're being asked to make some major transformations. These changes are slow and perhaps subtle, but they're important and need addressing. This is where the help of friends can come in handy.",
"Today you might experience a bit of restlessness, perhaps because you feel there's something you ought to be doing but you aren't sure what. Your mind is sharp, intuitive, and logical, but too many options could be on the horizon. You might find it difficult to choose among them. Once you decide, you'll charge ahead and make a success of whatever you try.",
"Bizarre and unexpected events lie in store for you today, so don't be surprised if not everything goes according to plan. Take note that these events may be part of a larger trend indicative of a tremendous opportunity. Heed the subtleties of this wave of energy. Latch onto it and see it as a major time of growth and expansion in your life.",
"The primary focus today should be on romance and commitment. Have you been thinking about getting married? If so, you could be surprised to learn that your significant other has been thinking the same thing. This could be the end of a long period of uncertainty. It's apt to prove a very healing experience. Don't be surprised if people tell you how attractive you look!",
"Surliness on the part of a partner could catapult you into a gloomy mood. Your friend isn't communicating very well, and you probably wonder if it's something you said or did. Chances are it's not. All signs indicate that it's business. Don't try to force your partner to share these concerns with you, as this will only cause further retreat. Your friend will talk when the time's right.",
"It's hard to stay centered now. Your mind is on something wonderful that's happening for you. Yesterday it was a fantasy and now it's real! You may be walking around in a daze trying to make sense of it all. Eventually you have to come down and face reality again, but there's no need to do it now. Things like this don't happen very often.",
"A woman, perhaps your mother, could visit you today. She may not be in a great mood, so perhaps you'd better take her out in public where she'll have to maintain some self-control. If not, you could set yourself up for a scolding over something that seems inconsequential. Defuse the situation by encouraging her to talk about what's really bothering her. It's probably not you.",
"The main things you need to do today are relax and enjoy your day. You may be feeling a bit under the weather and have a trip coming up that doesn't exactly thrill you. Stay alert, because you may receive an important message today from someone far away. You may also have a visitor arriving from out of town.",
"The love you feel for everyone today draws new people into your orbit. You're in love with all, even people you couldn't stand yesterday. If you're in sales or a field that puts you in contact with many people, you can expect extraordinary success. People will do whatever it takes and pay any amount of money to connect with you. This applies to your personal life, too.",
"Love and passion may be on your mind. If you aren't currently involved, you might be attracted to someone you know through business, so a little caution is advised. Suggest a professional lunch or dinner and then see where it goes. You might not get what you want today, but you could create new potential for tomorrow!",
"You've always been practical when it comes to financial matters, but sometimes consumerism can cause you some stress. Of course you want to show the special person in your life how much you care, but do you need to spend a lot of money to prove it? Find a balance you can both live with. You don't need to buy a car. A small token of thoughtfulness would be appreciated.",
"Resist the urge to go on a shopping spree today. You're likely to make impulsive purchases. You may be trying to fill a void or compensate for another area of your life that isn't going as well as you'd like. Try instead to do a little meditation and bring the real problem into clearer focus. Take a walk or do some yoga. It will do your spirit more good than the mall.",
"The planetary energies today are emphasizing family. This may be a good time to do some research, delving more deeply into your roots. Have you picked your grandmother's brain about her mother and grandmother? You'll be surprised at what you learn. You'll feel more connected with your family, and you may learn some facts that make you proud of your heritage.",
"Once you take the first step today, the rest of the way will be a piece of cake. Before you know it, you'll have completed the entire marathon with very little sweat on your brow. The one thing to watch out for is that you don't run over anyone in your dash to the finish line. Be careful of the runners beside you and treat them as friends and supporters instead of opponents.",
"Someone that you don't really know well may corner you at a social occasion and try to talk you into something. Get all the facts before you commit to anything. Your persuasive powers are high. If you have a project to pitch to someone, this is the day to do it, or at least map out your strategy. Success is strongly indicated for any project you start today.",
"You may have to take major action today in order to defend your position. Your current mindset has brought you to a certain point and now you're faced with having to defend that point. It may feel like the school bully is demanding your lunch money. Don't give in without a fight. The bully is just as frightened of you as you are of him.",
"Contact with a lot of friends may take place today. Invitations to social events could come your way. Your relationship with your friends is congenial. You could be introduced to new friends. Some of the people you meet could be from distant states or foreign lands or involved in unusual occupations. This could prove an exciting, stimulating day.",
"Vague physical discomfort could have you feeling out of sorts. Most likely you aren't really ill. You're tired and stressed, but you can make it through the day. Disillusionment with someone you've admired could also be on your mind. You could be seeking someone else for a role model. You'll feel better tomorrow!",
"You may have sniffles or a sore throat, possibly necessitating taking time off from work. This could be unwelcome, as it keeps you from going out on a date as well. Try to keep your mind occupied with activities that don't tire you physically. And take some vitamin C!",
"A long journey to a distant place could be uppermost in your mind today. You may be getting ready to take off, or the trip might still be in the planning stages. Either way, this could be a very exciting day. You're feeling happy and enthusiastic. You look forward to the future. Long-term goals might finally show promise of success.",
"Be careful about going overboard with your sarcasm. Some people take your comments seriously. Not everyone understands your humor. This could make communication unclear at times. Deliver a straight story without exaggeration or embellishment thrown in to make things juicier. Don't just tell the truth - tell the whole truth. You'll feel better about the situation.",
"You may feel like you're riding a fast train to success. Success can be measured in different ways. Today it's important that you consider your emotional success and how your feelings fit into your life. You may discover that the train you're on isn't the train you should be on. Don't be afraid to get off at the next station and transfer to a different line.",
"It may be that you've come back deeply changed from a long voyage. Of course, travel changes everyone to some extent, but in your case, the change is more profound. You're going to have a problem getting back into your old life. It may feel too limiting for you. So what are you waiting for? Change it!",
"Have you been trying to learn about a subject for a long time? Have books, lectures, and documentaries on the subject been your primary form of entertainment? Whatever you've been hoping to gain from it could come to you today. If it's a business advantage, you've got it. If it's knowledge for its own sake, you know a lot by now. Whatever it is, bask in the glow of your achievement.",
"Your intuition has been especially high for a while now. Today you could decide to put it to practical use. You might consider a class or workshop that increases your ability to communicate. New friends who share this interest could appear on the scene. Whatever ideas or insights come your way may originate from the higher planes. Write them down.",
"Today you might feel unloved even though there's no real reason for it. Your relationships should be pretty strong, but your biorhythms are down so you might be lacking in self-confidence. Phone a close friend and get together. Go shopping or to a movie and raise your spirits. By the end of the day you'll feel like your old self again!",
"Some visitors could come to your home today, perhaps a couple with a child. You'll go through the place like a whirlwind and want everything to look just right. You might even be tempted to clean out the closets! Don't bother. Just relax and enjoy the company of your guests. They're more interested in what you have to say than whether or not the house is spotless.",
"Dare to express your ideas without fearing ridicule. This is what the planetary configuration has to say to you today. This is exactly what you like, because fear of ridicule is generally your downfall. The challenge for you is to say what you think clearly without borrowing the ideas of others. Dare to do it!",
"Some bad experiences regarding career, family, travel, or education could have a friend, colleague, or love partner in an explosive mood today. This person could be unpredictable now - happy one minute and in the depths of gloom the next. Don't try to give advice or cheer up him or her. It will only result in anger. Stay out of the way and let your friend work through it.",
"You might be in a whirlwind today, and there will be information buzzing around asking you to do this and go there. You're the one most perfectly suited to deal with the tone of the day. Stay lively and upbeat. Don't get stuck on any one thing. Keep the energy moving. The answer will be right there waiting for you.",
"Issues regarding love and romance are in your favor. There's a strong force spurring you to take action. Heed this helpful energy. Feel free to display yourself openly in the social arena. Talk among friends could be rewarding for you now. All sorts of connections are favored for you today.",
"A strong transforming force may be pulling you in opposite directions now. Long-term trends are coming to a climax. Karma that you haven't resolved over the past few years may come back to haunt you. Today's planetary lineup is turning up the heat on your present situation. You're going to need your flameproof suit.",
"You've been exerting yourself a little too much over the past few days and might feel a little listless. Nonetheless, your mind is still active, and you may seek stimulation through books, TV, or lectures of some kind. You should find whatever you learn exciting. It could set you off in a new direction. Today you could turn into an armchair traveler!",
"Your mind may be on spiritual or philosophical subjects and considering fascinating new ideas. Some of these may come from faraway lands, which might have you considering travel. Friends or groups may bring these ideas your way or you could present the concepts to them. Take a walk before going to bed or you'll never get to sleep with all these ideas buzzing through your mind!",
"If you experience resistance or frustration in a certain area, you should take this as a sign that you should follow a new route. Things should flow smoothly and easily. This is one of those days in which reality is going to conflict harshly with fantasy, especially if you don't have them well separated in your mind. Enjoy your imaginary world, but deal with the practical world, too.",
"Career matters are probably going well for you, but you might be unsure if you want to continue along this track. You might consider other options, perhaps some you've always wanted to try but have never been in a position to do. Don't feel you have to decide now. You have plenty of time. Don't make a move until you're sure.",
"Although some people may think of you as a space cadet when it comes to decisions and commitments, they may see a different side of you today. Don't be surprised if others come around to your camp once they hear your side of the story. Somehow all the pieces are fitting into place just like you knew they would. Those who doubted you will be pleasantly surprised.",
"Turn one part of the project over to someone you feel is more qualified to handle it. There's no sense trying to do everything yourself when you know someone out there is better suited to the task. Today calls for a steady and patient hand. If you don't think you have the skills, admit it. You'll gain more respect by delegating than by trying to muddle through.",
"Strong forces may make it hard for you to be confident today. You're so intent on maintaining your freedom that you refuse to yield when you should. Consider the other side of the equation before you become so adamant that you refuse to budge. At the same time, don't automatically think that just because you're running into opposition your way of thinking is necessarily wrong.",
"Social events could take up a lot of your time tonight, and you may enjoy being in contact with friends you haven't seen for a while. Conversations should be fascinating. You may even discover a new interest. An encounter with your partner could prove more passionate than usual. This should be a thoroughly enjoyable day as long as you conserve your energy.",
"A rush of optimism and enthusiasm could propel you into a more positive frame of mind, and you could accomplish wonders. Your circumstances may be turned upside down. A move is possible, as is a change in your work. Don't cling to the shore - flow with the current. Success and good fortune are on the way as long as you let them happen!",
"Working closely with someone might bring up some strong, warm affection between you. It may or may not be a romantic attraction, but if it is, don't read too much into it now. The situation is creating the emotions. There's the chance that the attraction could pass by tomorrow. But you've probably found someone with whom you can collaborate harmoniously. That's important!",
"Information on psychology, particularly dreams, could capture your imagination. You could decide to collect as much information as you can. The dark side of the personality may be especially appealing. You'll remember anything you read or hear today, as your mind is particularly retentive. This includes financial trends and ways to increase your income.",
"Your mind may be in an expansive mode now. Many things should be working for you. Your flexibility and ability to juggle many things at once should make tasks that require these talents a breeze. Unfortunately, they may not help too much when it comes to love and romance. You may not have the communication you desire with a close partner. You could find it easier to communicate with strangers!",
"Optimism and excitement permeate any get-togethers that you're involved in today. You and those around you tend to see only positive trends for the future - success with few obstacles. You need to hang onto that attitude because there are always obstacles. You might forge a new support group with some of these upbeat individuals. Make the most of it!",
"Whatever difficulties may have arisen over the past few days, you have the power to overcome them, gain new strength, and move on. Your physical energy is good - you won't wear out. You'll probably push on and take care of each chore as it comes up. If you've been thinking of starting a new project, this is the day to do it. Obstacles won't stop you.",
"You love to meet new people and talk to them, but you rarely get personally involved. You keep a certain distance between you and the person you're talking to. Today you'll wonder if you're missing out on interesting experiences by controlling your emotions so tightly, or if your defenses are high for a good reason.",
"Do you have a talent for writing? You seem to have a precise and clear way of expressing yourself. And it's possible you use this gift of yours in your career. Today you might want to use it to express your feelings about someone. Whether you write to a family member or compose a love letter, you'll be particularly inspired.",
"Travel to distant lands is a possibility. While you're ready for a change, don't jump at the first opportunity that comes along. What you're being offered is a long-term commitment, if not a lifelong one. Think twice before you say yes. However, even if you do say yes, you won't regret your decision.",
"Someone you need to contact for information may be temporarily unavailable. You might have to try to find whatever you need somewhere else. This could be difficult. You could go in circles as you're referred to someone who refers you back to the person you can't reach. You might have to put off this problem and work on something else.",
"As much as you enjoy being out with people, tonight is a good evening for rest. If you can, try taking the afternoon off. Curl up in your favorite chair with a good book, take a slow walk through a garden, or putter in the kitchen and cook something fabulous. You need some time to refuel your soul. You'll tackle your projects tomorrow, relaxed and rejuvenated.",
"Some bizarre dreams or visions could come to you today. Don't put too much stock in them. You might find that the images are partly scenes from your past, partly information you've received lately, and partly your own fears about the future. If you view them this way, you should be able to see what they're telling you. They aren't prophesies for the future.",
"Your tendency is to rush headlong into a new project. Not everyone is caught up in your enthusiasm. Be careful not to steamroll over those you care about most. Your partner, especially, feels a bit miffed and left out at the moment. Do what you can to soothe any ruffled feathers. It might be time to set aside your project in favor of a romantic outing.",
"It's true that you aren't ten anymore, but who's to say you can't go back to your childhood now and again? Without going so far as to play hopscotch in the street or instigate a food fight in your favorite restaurant, go see some friends for some laughs. You've been working hard for a long time now and deserve a bit of fun. Don't hesitate.",
"You may feel like a racehorse crammed in the starting gate. You're stuck in a small spot, stomping your feet, and anxiously waiting for the starting bell. You may feel powerless since you have no control over when the gate will open. Be patient. Don't waste all your energy fidgeting. The gate will open soon enough and you'll be up and running.",
"You may be uncomfortable with the emotional intensity that's likely to seep into every part of your day. You may wonder what the big deal is and why people are so hopped up over nothing. Perhaps this is your cue to take things more seriously and act with more sensitivity. Your detachment can be an asset, but it could be your biggest enemy on a day like this.",
"Group activities or get-togethers with friends may not go as well as usual today. You're feeling more reserved and perhaps preoccupied about a friend or romantic partner with whom you might be on the outs. Oddly enough, getting out with others is probably the best therapy in spite of your increased shyness. Maybe the best thing to do is to go out alone where people congregate.",
"A new or existing romance could take on a spiritual aspect that creates a stronger bond between you. The works of past great masters, perhaps some from exotic lands, inspire your creative drive. Spirituality could take on new importance to you. You might want to spend time meditating or studying. Past-life regression or guided meditation could prove enlightening.",
"Tension between you and a business partner could have you doubting your professional future in the current situation. Don't waste too much time worrying about it. You may not be aware of it now, but career and money matters are going well and are likely to continue like this for a while. Of course, that depends on you and what you're willing to do to keep it going.",
"Things should be going your way, and you may feel like quite a bit is getting done without your having to lift a finger. At the same time, a nagging voice in the back of your mind is telling you to watch your back. Have all your bases covered. While you may be tempted to go with the most comfortable and familiar, this is a good time to consider other perspectives.",
"It's going to be a great day to get things done. Cosmic conditions will have you feeling energetic and raring to go. If there's a list of things to do waiting for you, grab it and get going. You might need to resist the temptation to spend time socializing. If you focus on your priorities, you'll be finished before you know it and there will still be plenty of time left for play.",
"You may be caught in a difficult quandary. Your attention to other people's needs may draw you into dramas that you don't want to be part of. As a result, you may be indecisive and unsure of how to proceed. You must find the balance between taking care of your needs and being considerate of others. You'll be confident of your decision once you've made it."]
