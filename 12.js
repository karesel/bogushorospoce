You will need the comfort if nothing else.",

This person seems to be in total accord with you about nearly everything, and warm feelings could flow between you.

"More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Pisces. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow.

"Your heart may feel extra loving today, Pisces, which is good, since you will probably need it. There is most likely someone close to you who needs a lift of some sort. You may be like the tow truck that arrives to pull a car out of the ditch. Be careful when you hook up the chains. Don't scratch the bumper or pull too hard all at once!",
"A visitor may come over today, Pisces, but you might wonder why this person bothered. He or she may seem distracted and more inclined to listen to what you say than offer any conversation. Chances are that your friend felt lonely and needed some company. Be flattered. Don't be afraid to launch into a monologue about something you find fascinating. It may be just what your friend needs.",
"You might feel especially playful today, Pisces. You can expect to feel a great deal of love and affection from others.

Overcome this by looking forward to intimate plans with someone tonight.",
"A surge of passion could dominate your day unless you find an outlet for it, Pisces. Romantic passion is high, so an intimate evening with a lover is a good idea. Creative passion is strong.

Creativity is as important as anything else.",
"Career developments could look promising now, Pisces, and you might be in a hurry to finish whatever needs to be done. But responsibilities to home and family might interfere.

If you stop trying to remember, they may come back to you.",
"A group with which you're affiliated may be temporarily torn apart by politics and quarrels. If so, Pisces, it's best to stay out of it.

This could be a frustrating day for you - one best spent working on your own projects. All will be better tomorrow.",
"Your intuitive abilities are at an all-time high today, Pisces. You should find it easier to tune into others' thoughts and feelings. It might be a good idea to control your reactions to them.

"Things may be calm today, Pisces. You might not be your boisterous self, but that could be a good thing. Use the sobering energy to evaluate your emotions and honestly look at your relationships.

What do they mean to you and how can you apply them to your situation?",
"A meeting may take place today that you don't want to attend, Pisces. It could be long and boring, but you should still make the effort to listen. Colleagues will want to discuss the issues with you afterward, and you might learn something in spite of the boredom. Think of it this way - it's only an hour or so. Concentrate on what's being said and not on the clock.",
"Time alone is essential for everyone, Pisces, but make sure you recognize when you're isolated to the point where it's unhealthy. If you realize you're alone because you're avoiding something, you might consider your alternatives. Things will only fester under these conditions. Face whatever it is that's upsetting you so you can begin to work things out.",
"If you happen to meet new people today, Pisces, be careful. Some folks appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing. This may seem interesting, but it can lead to trouble and hurt you if you aren't careful. Stick to your usual standards and ethics. If danger excites you too much, it may be time to reexamine your life and change things.",
"One day, I want to be�. When you were little, how did you finish that sentence, Pisces? See what your memory and imagination come up with. Is your life what you dreamed it would be? If not, consider what you could do to change it. Maybe you should lie on your back and gaze at the clouds or stars. This childlike activity may spark some ideas for you.",
"Today, Pisces, you will probably have a ton of energy at your disposal for getting into all kinds of activities. Finish any work that still needs to be completed. Do some cleaning and organizing or see about getting out for a little warm weather fun. Whatever you choose, try to make sure it's active. You will need a place for all that energy to go. Quiet sedentary pursuits won't do it for you.",
"Step out of your routine, Pisces. Do this every so often to increase your knowledge and expand your horizons. The planetary aspects favor this.

See what you can discover about yourself and the world.",
"If certain projects or tasks have seemed difficult to finish, take advantage of the energy provided by today's planetary aspects. This energy will give you all the zip you need, Pisces. It's a good time to meet with others to discuss important matters. Your communication and cooperation skills will be increased. You can make decisions much more quickly than usual. Have a productive day!",
"There's something in the air pushing you toward change or renewal. Is it time to change your wardrobe or redecorate your home? If so, today's the day. If you have a budget, you will find it just as fulfilling (and a lot cheaper) to rid your home of all the things that just aren't \"you\" anymore. Surround yourself with things you love.",
"A new fascination with history or an exotic culture could drive you to learn more about it, Pisces. It could become an obsession, for today at least. You might spend a lot of time online or in the library or talking to people who specialize in this field. By day's end, your mind could be spinning like a top. Take a walk and clear your head or you might not be able to sleep.",
"This is a terrific day for you, Pisces. You can accomplish a great deal when you set your mind in motion. There's a strong, warlike instinct within you that's fired up and ready to fight. Leave your worries at the doorstep, because there's no need to hesitate on a day like this. Your kingdom is ready for you. Be strong and remember that the best way to lead people is to walk behind them.",
"You're quite sure of yourself and solid about many things except one. When it comes to romantic relationships, you feel a bit unsure and inadequate, Pisces. It could be that you're indecisive about how to proceed. There's a strong urge to take charge, but also a tendency to slow things down and let others take the lead. Figure out your needs before you make long-term plans with others.",
"Your physical and mental energies overflow today, Pisces. You may want to tackle every possible project that could bring advancement along whatever lines you want.

You feel passionate about everything!",
"You may be a bit aggravated today, Pisces. People seem to be more of a hindrance than a help to you. Don't be too accusatory until you make sure that you're operating honestly and productively. You may automatically go into defensive mode and end up accusing someone of the very thing that you're guilty of.",
"Like a surfer who wants to ride the endless wave, you must first prepare yourself before you jump into the ocean with your board, Pisces.

You will find that the more preparation you do, the more secure you will be when you hit the water.",
"Sudden and unexpected problems could have your household in chaos, Pisces. This probably doesn't relate to difficulties with your housemates. It's more likely to involve problems with wiring, appliances, or phone lines. It could be annoying to deal with repairmen in and out of your house, but you will have to bear with it. You want your household back to normal as soon as possible.",
"Pessimism over money matters may plague you today, Pisces. Perhaps a desired increase in income hasn't materialized, or you've been hoping to make a particular purchase that you still can't quite afford. This might be the time to put your ingenuity to work and come up with a contingency plan to earn the money you need. You will be able to find good opportunities. It beats waiting!",
"You're adapting to your changing environment as quickly as you can, Pisces.

You already have plenty on your mind. They're going to have to be patient!",
"Today you might gather with some very smart friends at a coffee house for an intellectual conversation, Pisces. Some fascinating ideas and useful information could be exchanged.

Take care not to spread rumors that you don't know to be true.",
"Today you might decide to host an impromptu party, Pisces, and a lot of merry and interesting people could attend. You will have a lot of fun, blow off steam, and feel pleasantly exhausted when it's over. Go for it! The only problem is one member of your household might not be up for too much noise. Try to make certain everyone keeps their voices down and don't play any loud music.",

You can look forward to all the romantic possibilities that come with exploring new lands together. It's bound to be a wonderful trip.",
"Trust your instincts regarding anyone you meet today, Pisces. There are unethical people around, and one of them may enter your circle. Entering into legal contracts or business or personal partnerships of any kind is absolutely out of the question. Don't even go to renew your driver's license, as you're likely to fail the eye exam! Stay home and save contracts and bureaucracy for another day.",
"You may feel a little upset and somewhat depressed by a temporary separation from a loved one. As a result, you might throw your energy into creative projects.

Just express yourself clearly.",
"Educational or spiritual growth on your part is likely to attract new friends who could become close companions. There could even be a new romantic partner in the bunch. This comes from the expansion of your mind, Pisces. The new people should share your interests and turn into companions on your quest for enlightenment. Accept their friendship and move ahead. Don't look back - you can't go back.",
"Today is one of those days when you might feel like four people have a hold of each of your limbs, Pisces. The people are tugging and you're getting stretched in every direction.

"You have a tremendous amount of drive and enthusiasm to help you move forward in your projects, Pisces. Be careful that you don't act hastily or impulsively. Be careful of starting out on a new path without having a good idea about where it's going. Rash decisions may lead to dangerous situations, so know what direction to go in before you start the car. Be safe.",
"A relationship that you may have recently formed might have you in a dither today, Pisces. This could be romantic or some other sort of acquaintance.

Wait a few days, get to know the person a little better, and then consider your options.",

"You might find it difficult to connect with others today, Pisces. Your brain may seem like it's in some other dimension. Appreciate the power of circular movement in your life.

"Love and romance are in the air tonight, so feel free to let loose, Pisces. Instead of being a passive, gentle, soft kind of love, the emotion you feel may be more forceful, passionate, and aggressive. Roll with this feeling as you seduce the object of your desire. Take charge in the bedroom as you lure your mate with your fantastic love of life and desire to have a good time.",
"Take action that will help you find greater freedom in your life, Pisces. In an attempt to please the people around you, you may be giving up too much of yourself.

"Tackle things that require high energy today, Pisces. This is your day to make short work of chores, errands, or any sort of physical activity.

Your heart is apt to sing once you get going on a personal project about which you feel passionate.",
"Have fun today, Pisces, but make sure you're always professional and polite. Appearance and a good-natured demeanor will get you far.

Note that relationships with women are apt to be especially rewarding on a day like this.",
"Don't just talk about grand trips around the world - start planning them, Pisces. If you don't start saving your resources and reserving blocks of time for your dreams, they may never come true. Today is a good time to set things in motion. Your attitude is likely to be more flexible, and you will find that this way of thinking will bring you to the people and places that can help you the most.",
"Today you might be pleasantly surprised to realize that you're in far better financial shape than you thought. You could discover a hidden talent for money management that you didn't think you had. You might also be anticipating a raise or some other increase in income. Optimism and enthusiasm are what drive you today, Pisces. Your hopes for the future seem more grounded in reality than ever.",
"The vast social whirl of late might have overwhelmed you with new names and faces, all of which you want to remember. Today would be a good day to follow up with some of them by phone, postcard, or email. Your charisma and sincerity are likely to have made just as much of an impression on them as they did on you, Pisces. Don't be shy.",
"For the past few days your mind has been primarily on the loftier side of romance - emotional support, a spiritual bond, the highest kind of love. Today your mind is likely to be on nothing more exalted than physical passion. You can expect to be obsessed with sex all day. Schedule some quality time alone with a lover. If you can't, you might have to make do with a romantic video.",
"Today's planetary energies may put spiritual matters in your mind, Pisces. You may not be thinking in religious terms. Your focus is likely to be on the state of humanity and what you can do to help others less fortunate. Make some calls or do some research online. Find out how you can get involved. If you're short on time, a monetary gift can help you feel more connected and peaceful.",
"Children may be a part of your day today, Pisces. You might attend a party for children or a larger gathering that includes them. At some point you might even be telling them a story. This will probably be as much fun for you as for your audience, who are likely to be very appreciative. Don't be afraid to ham it up a little - they'll love it!",
"If you've been considering a career in writing or teaching, Pisces, this is an ideal day to put some plans into motion. Your imagination and inspiration are highlighted, as is your facility with words. This combination pretty much guarantees that you could sell anything to anyone. If you're ready to pitch a book proposal to a publisher, do it now.",
"Romance is in the air today, Pisces. Alas, it seems to rain down on everyone but you. You must have put on your romance-repellent raincoat before leaving the house this morning. Don't fret. Your time will come. Try to focus your passion on a creative endeavor. If you've been thinking about trying your hand at writing or painting, do it now.",
"Juggling work and home may seem difficult today, Pisces. Work responsibilities may weigh on your mind to the point where they interfere with the harmony of your home life. This can cause some inner conflict. It might be wise to prioritize work tasks on paper and schedule duties and deadlines. Then you can spend time with your family without worrying that work will be forgotten.",
"Money matters are highlighted today, Pisces. You can expect to spend a lot of time with the calculator as you balance your checkbook or begin to work on your budget. Even if you don't consider yourself particularly good with numbers, you will do a great job. You're conscientious. Success in all endeavors is indicated today.",
"Family problems may have a friend or love partner feeling unsettled and helpless, Pisces. This person could have a few communication problems, especially if firmness is required. Don't get sucked into the situation. Just point out the facts and encourage your friend to consider every factor on its own merits. While you do this, you might have some insights into a problem of your own.",
"The desire to stay home alone and rest tonight might conflict with a need to go out with your friends, Pisces. You may be too stressed to put up with gossip or too much intellectual stimulation. Tell your friends you will go out with them another time. All signs indicate that this is the wisest course for now. Relax with some hot chocolate and a pile of movies.",
"You may be fidgeting, Pisces, given your general restlessness. You're anxious to get up and do some sort of song and dance, and yet you insist on waiting for the right time. Meanwhile, you're getting extremely anxious for your big moment. You're in charge of your own show. If you feel ready to go on, don't wait. Added anxiety will only cause you to forget your lines.",
"Take your focus off you and concentrate on someone else for a day, Pisces. This doesn't mean focusing so the person will stop and pay attention to you. It doesn't mean getting their attention so that you have someone who will listen to you talk. Get someone's attention because you really want to hear what he or she has to say.",
"Let your guard down today, Pisces. Don't feel like you need to perform for anyone. Accept the notion that you're perfect the way you are. You don't have to prove your self-worth to anyone. Let your heart expand and your mind rest. Make sure the pure glow within you is lighting the path. Don't allow an artificial mask to block the reality of your true identity.",
"Respect your superiors today, Pisces. There's great wisdom to be learned, so keep your eyes and ears open. Hasty actions are bound to get you in trouble. Don't step blindly into situations. Make sure you have all the facts before you proceed. The information is out there, but you have to be patient to find it. Make sure your goals are worthy before extend yourself trying to reach them.",
"A friend may ask to borrow some money today, Pisces. You may feel that he or she is asking for more than is really needed, and certainly more than you're willing to give. You might think this puts you in an awkward position. Try to talk to your friend and explain your situation. If you have to say no, just say it. A real friend will understand and look elsewhere for the money.",
"You've made it over the hump, Pisces. You've moved beyond the problems of the recent past and are entering a more peaceful phase.

"A large gathering, perhaps a festival of some kind, could take place in your neighborhood today, Pisces. You could choose to attend with some close friends and your romantic interest.

"A warm, interesting phone call from a current or potential love partner could have you longing for this person's company, Pisces. You should have a lot to say to each other and so spend a lot of time on the phone. A meeting could be arranged, probably somewhere in your neighborhood. Your chemistry is intense, so don't be surprised by the direction of this involvement.",
"Changes within a group you're affiliated with might profoundly affect you today, Pisces. Perhaps the group is veering in a new direction that doesn't particularly interest you. You might need to reevaluate your involvement. This could make you rather sad since you've grown fond of the people and won't want to lose them as friends. You need to think. Only you can decide what to do.",
"You may feel great about yourself, Pisces. It's no mystery why. You're looking better than you have in months. People are responding to you very favorably. You will get some admiring glances as you walk down the street. You can't help but draw attention to yourself. Your good feeling applies not only to you but also to those around you. Your loved ones are especially dear to your heart right now.",
"You have big plans, Pisces, and your dreams may be keeping you from paying attention to your work. Don't get too stressed. You've never missed a deadline, so you know that one way or another you will get everything done. In the meantime, begin to make plans for your next getaway. Plaster your office with photos of exotic locations to satisfy your wanderlust for the time being.",
"Is a romantic partner having trouble communicating with family, Pisces? If so, be prepared to hear about it today. Be a good listener. Your understanding and objectivity will be greatly appreciated. Your beloved probably isn't seeing the real facts and needs an outside party to point this out. However, avoid the temptation to patronize. You could end up in the same doghouse!",
"You may discover your emotions are tempered today, as you want to turn inward, Pisces. You're apt to surprise yourself and the people around you when you decide that all you want to do is go into your room and sit by yourself instead of join the crowd outside. Don't feel bad about doing this even if you're expected at the party in full regalia. Do what feels most natural for you.",
"A current or potential romantic partner might seem like the most perfect, wonderful person in the world to you, Pisces. Your romantic nature could get the better of you today. Don't gaze at your partner all dewy eyed! Instead, try to maintain a certain distance to avoid appearing too needy. It was probably your self-sufficiency and inner power that attracted your lover in the first place.",
"You and a current or potential romantic partner may be in a strange space today, Pisces. Intellectual awareness battles emotional doubts. Communication could be vague and easily misinterpreted, so choose your words carefully, even though it may be difficult to find the right ones. Your relationship should survive the day, but your understanding of each other could suffer if you aren't careful.",
"A close friend or romantic partner might be in a negative mood today, Pisces. You may want to try to lift this person out of that mood. Take your friend to a sporting event, party, or funny movie. If you're refused at first, don't take no for an answer! It will do your friend good to get out of that funk, and it will do you good as well!",
"Take extra care with your appearance today, and clean the house a bit this morning. You may have some visitors, Pisces. Invite them in and make them comfortable.

Or maybe you will get an interesting stock tip. Stay alert!",
"Don't be surprised if you bump into an old friend or colleague today, Pisces. This chance encounter could have a dramatic ripple effect on you as you reflect on your life and analyze how far you've come. You may realize you aren't entirely pleased with your direction. Your friend may point out that there are many paths to happiness. Perhaps it's time to choose another one.",
"Less is more should be your motto for today, Pisces. The more you cut back in certain areas of your life, the more room you open up to bring in new and exciting things. Go ahead and say no to people, and don't feel badly about it. Take care of yourself and your needs as much as you take care of the needs of the people around you.",
"You're feeling strong, energetic, and likely to be inspired to get some real work done around the house, Pisces.

This day won't be the epitome of intellectual activity, but you will be rewarded with a tidy living space.",
"You generally enjoy your dreams, Pisces, both the dreaming process and analyzing them later. But tonight you might have too many to keep track of. While you will probably recall the most significant ones, it may be frustrating if you forget any of them. This might be the day to start a dream diary, if you don't have one. Have fun!",
"You can expect your love life to take a dramatic turn for the better, Pisces. This may be because you feel more self-confident than you have in a long time. In addition, you feel great and look even better. It's no wonder your romantic partner is reacting to you in such a powerful, positive way. Make the most of this opportunity by spending some quality time together.",
"You could receive some sort of windfall today, Pisces. Use it wisely. Consider buying some time to figure out what you want to do with your life. It's likely that your career isn't exactly ringing your bells these days. You're ready for new challenges and opportunities. Meditate on what would make you happy and then take a systematic approach to achieving it.",
"If you're concerned about the love that certain close people have for you, you shouldn't try to compensate by being clingy or overly affectionate. This period is about keeping your distance and putting your relationships into perspective to see what they're really worth to you, Pisces. Someone may ask you for an even stronger commitment over the next few months.",
"You may feel like walking barefoot, comforting your friends, or playing with children. There's a tenderness and openness in the air that affects everyone. It will be like a wonderful day in the country, where everyone is happy to see each other, hug, and tell old family stories for the hundredth time. These days make young people laugh and old people smile.",
"Your naturally loving nature gets a boost today, Pisces. You could look especially attractive, so don't be surprised if you draw admiring looks from strangers. Romantic novels and movies could seem appealing now, but you're more interested in the real thing. If you can, try to schedule alone time with the special person in your life. You won't regret it!",
"Today you may try to contact several people, Pisces, none of whom may be available. You might particularly want to reach a female friend or relative who lives far away.

She might even invite you to visit!",
"Some differences of opinion concerning your love life may come up today, Pisces. You could find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself.

The day ahead could bring you just what you seek.",
"It's often said that your energy feeds on strong emotions. Situations that require some daring are an excellent source of such excitement. This is the key to understanding the day ahead, Pisces. True, you can expect some hair-raising encounters, but how better to show off your skills as either an employee or passionate partner?",
"Why not say yes a little more than usual, Pisces? You can be stubborn and want to do only what you want. It isn't easy to lead you into the unknown. You like to prepare in advance. Today when people make unusual propositions, why not go agree? Go on - jump in without looking for a change. It will do wonders for your outlook.",
"You're often moved by emotion, Pisces. You like situations that make you feel alive. Today your love life may give you just that kind of adventurous feeling. If that's the case, don't get so far into your emotions that it becomes too much for you. There is such a concept as too much of a good thing!",
"Pisces, you may have had some confused emotions about your relationship or family over the past few days. You may not have been able to fully express your worries to others. But today these emotions will find a way to come out. Look around you. There might be someone right next to you who can help with your problems.",
"Your partner's family obligations could interfere with things you wanted to do together, Pisces. Your desire to help could also get in the way of other responsibilities. The best way to handle days like today is to plan carefully. There's always a way to squeeze it all in. This may be what you have to do.",
"The desire to travel, perhaps to visit a close friend, may come up today, Pisces. You may put a lot of energy into exploring the possibilities.

Caution is always called for in tricky situations.",
"Control issues in your home are apt to be of concern today, Pisces. Be careful about feeding into others' misconceptions of the situation. You're dealing with powerful, opinionated forces that aren't going to want to budge. Someone may have a warped view of the true issue at hand. Lay all the facts on the table before you start drawing any conclusions.",
"You're in the middle of a terrific yearly transition. You have a great deal of physical energy, Pisces. You have an action-oriented mind ready to tackle anything. The key to making the most of this fortunate period is communication. Right now you have multitasking abilities that you can put to good use once you connect with others and understand exactly what needs to be done.",
"Take extra time to tend to your appearance and show off a bit today, Pisces. Keep your shoulders back and head high. Be the proud person you are. You should feel validated. Your job today is to simply uplift people with your presence. This is no sweat for you. Happiness is right up your alley, so have fun.",
"Organizing your office and paying bills are likely to be on your agenda today, Pisces. You could feel overwhelmed by the tasks, and you might be tempted to put them off. It's better to take it slowly until you get everything done. You don't have to do them all at once. This should lessen the stress. Spend a quiet evening at home.",
"You're currently stuck between two strong desires - the desire to create for your own pleasure and the desire to please others. You come by this latter urge naturally, as it's part of your character. It will understandably be difficult for you to resolve this dissonance. The solution for you comes from asking why you feel such a strong need to be appreciated.",
"Something strange may happen today. Someone in your family may reproach you for having chosen your profession. It may be that your career has little connection with what people have traditionally done in your family. But just because a tradition is lost doesn't mean that it must be mourned, Pisces. Listen to your heart. If you've chosen a profession that you're truly meant for, you will know it.",

Your doubts may be groundless.",
"You aren't free enough, Pisces. This is especially true in your relationships. With the current astral energy, you can expect to break free of your chains. It's time for you to participate more in life. Speak your mind. Tell people what you want and when you want it. Surely one of your desires is freedom. Overcome your fear of rejection and ask for it! It really is as simple as that.",
"The day is likely to be somewhat challenging, and it contains some disappointments. You're liable to feel dejected if you receive a lackluster response from the world.

"You're embarking on a phase devoted in large part to your love life, Pisces! Make this time completely fulfilling by introducing fresh new ideas. Don't let these pleasures grow stale. The cycle ahead is extremely auspicious for romance. It's a good time to take a trip, just the two of you. If you're single, you may meet an uncommonly interesting new person.",
"A visitor with a few problems might come to your door in search of advice and sympathy, Pisces. He or she might also have some other news that could shock you. A professional crisis might make it necessary for you or your partner to spend most of the day away from home and family. This could be frustrating, particularly if you have to cancel plans. Hang in there!",
"Dreams and visions might come and go today, Pisces, as unconscious drives and images surface. Some of these impressions could represent old traumas or phobias that need to be released. You could also draw creative inspiration from these perceptions and use them as a basis for artistic projects. By day's end you may feel much lighter - emotionally, at least!",
"The fantasy world that you've built for yourself is a pleasure, Pisces. People frolic in it and have a grand time. Your presence delights people.

It's now time for a physical and psychological rest in order to let you fully integrate your experiences. The weeks ahead offer a calm and quiet oasis.",
"You may be shy when it comes to expressing your emotions today, Pisces. This could be a rare thing for you. Other people may wonder if something is wrong.

You're just going through an introspective period.",
"When did you last spend real quality time with your family - not counting regular chores? If it's been a while, today is a good day to do it.

As for your love life, some exciting opportunities may arise. Be on the lookout for them. Whatever you do, don't let them pass you by!",
"Your actions might be a bit strained today, Pisces. People aren't going to cooperate in the way you might like them to.

The harder you push, the more resistance you will encounter.",
"You're likely to enjoy a change in the rhythm and quality of life, beginning right now, Pisces. Do you feel a need to take your friendships beyond superficiality?

Keep your guard up.",
"If you keep waiting for things to happen, Pisces, you may wake up one morning and realize that your life has passed and you never did half the things you dreamed of doing.

Something may spur you to act.",
"Inspire others to come out of their shells today, Pisces. Have them join you on the sunny side of the street.

Incorporate both energies into your day.",

They will appreciate your patience and tolerance.",

"It's time to take charge, Pisces. There's fuel for your fire, and the scope of your influence is virtually unlimited. Don't hold back in any way.

"Confirmation of professional success could come your way, Pisces, and you're probably feeling excited and motivated to keep pushing. But you may find that increased responsibilities interfere with your social life. You wonder if friends have forgotten you. They haven't, but it will make you feel better if you squeeze in a few hours for your friends each week. Remember what they say about all work and no play.",
"Many projects to complete before a deadline might have you feeling pressured, Pisces, but your determination is likely to drive you to try to get it all done even if it seems impossible. Don't try to do it all yourself. Ask for a little help. You can accomplish your ends without putting undue pressure on yourself. Try to relax today.",
"Money worries might have you more on edge than usual, Pisces. While you may be doing well, you could still be insecure enough to think that your funds might not stretch far enough. Consider the situation objectively. You will probably be relieved by what you find. Others' demands on your time might irritate you more than usual. The best way to relieve the tension is to work out or take a walk.",
"There's a conservative feeling to the day that asks you to get serious and take care of business. This may not be such a bad idea. This grounded atmosphere can help you move into a deeper relationship with someone special. Let your creativity shine, and try to do more listening than talking. Make your dreams a reality.",
"You might have the desire for travel, perhaps to visit a friend who lives far away, Pisces. You may actually set the wheels in motion to make it happen. Social events could take up your time this evening, and you could meet some interesting people. A friend might need a sympathetic ear. Today you're especially sensitive to others, so be prepared to hear a sad story. Otherwise, your day should go well.",
"You're going to get it all today, Pisces. You may not feel especially powerful, and in fact there may be those who try to make you feel incompetent. Realize that this is a passing trend and you will soon bounce back to your true self. Open up a little more than usual and let more light into your life.",
"You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, Pisces. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.",
"Something or someone may prod you to take action today, Pisces. It may be best if you beat them to it and motivate yourself. Break away from the herd and go wherever you want to go. It's likely that you will run into conflict regarding an issue you feel strongly about. People may be stubborn, so prepare for a stalemate rather than any sort of resolution.",
"Jump back on stage and say what you have to say, Pisces. Your participation in the conversation is critical to maintaining a healthy energy flow. The things you say will have a profound effect on others, so chose your words carefully. Enjoy a physical activity that involves a group. Make it a social event. Be an active participant in all situations today.",
"Suddenly things are coming to a head for you, Pisces. The drama is escalating and you aren't sure if you can remember all your lines. Take things one step at a time. Deal with the issues as they come. If you get ahead of yourself, you might be overwhelmed by the fear that the situation will be more than you can handle. Don't sweat the small stuff.",
"Stop being an enabler to someone you care about, Pisces. You may let someone continue a dangerous addictive behavior simply because you want to avoid a confrontation. Realize that this behavior is doing neither of you any good. The more you continue to perpetrate the lie, the more it will hurt all parties involved. Be open and honest with your concerns.",
"Things may get a bit confusing today, Pisces. Don't feel like you need to make sense of it all. In fact, that may be impossible. Whatever you do, make sure you're being yourself. Let your creative nature shine through. Other people are quite malleable, so you should take the lead in just about any situation. Make sure that you're considerate of other people's needs.",
"You're at a dramatic climax in your monthly emotional cycle today, Pisces. It's quite possible that you will erupt like a volcano. Don't be ashamed about releasing these emotions. Your feminine and masculine natures are connected, and they're working harmoniously to express themselves to the fullest. Open up the gates of communication and let the stampede charge through.",
"You might come across strong opposition today. Someone may seem to want to cut straight through to your heart, Pisces. In reality, this is a message reminding you to think about things in terms of the collective, the oneness of all. Be aware of a greater perspective in which you see more than just your side of the issue. Discuss the issues with others before making any major decisions.",
"This isn't a day to focus on fun and games, Pisces. In fact, you may feel an annoying weightiness about your emotions, making you feel less energetic than usual. There's a sober tone asking you to look at reality and make some serious decisions about your future goals and plans. You may feel like the timer is about to buzz. The minute hand is ticking, and there are many more adventures to be had.",
"Things should go extremely well for you today, Pisces, so don't shy away from any part of it. In fact, take this opportunity to shine as brightly as you can. Crank up the power and project yourself out to the world. Bring out your radiant smile as often as possible - it's contagious. There is tremendous power behind your self-confidence, so tackle everything with energy and enthusiasm.",
"You tend to keep to yourself, Pisces, but today you could be inspired to join a group activity. Perhaps some friends have invited you to come out for drinks. Or maybe a neighbor asked you to consider joining a neighborhood organization. Whatever the scenario, all signs indicate that any group activity you join will be worthwhile. You will do some good and likely make new friends, too.",
"Connect with the fellow sitting next to you or perhaps the woman behind you in line at the store. He or she could share a piece of wisdom that changes your life forever. Be aware that you also could be that person who changes someone else's life with a single thought or slice of wisdom that you've picked up in your travels. Communication is the key to expanding your world in many ways.",
"The name of the game for you today is emotional freedom, Pisces. Your senses are heightened and the smallest things capture your eye. Don't delay your response to these events, whether they're big or small. Even the smallest event may blossom into a new world of people and situations. Let your creativity explode into every part of your being.",
"A position involving power and authority is opening up, and you're the perfect one for the job, Pisces. Today's astrological aspect is helping you find the necessary confidence and physical strength. You have the emotional and physical boost you need to feel good about your leadership abilities. This is a time to take control of the situation.",
"Dreams and visions might come and go today, Pisces, as unconscious images surface. Some of these impressions could represent old traumas and phobias that have outlived their usefulness and need to be released. You could draw creative inspiration from these perceptions and use them as a basis for artistic projects. By day's end you may feel emotionally lighter.",
"The day ahead will be trying for you, Pisces. You will have a fire raging inside. You may have a speech to deliver or a private performance to put on for your loved ones. In any case, you will have to prove yourself, and you will spare no energy in the attempt. You will be completely drained by the end of the day. Plan to rest.",
"There's a great wind under your wings today, Pisces, and you may find the day's energy quite transforming. You now have the opportunity to make great strides in whatever you wish to accomplish. It may be time for you to make an important change in your current attitude. Embrace differences in perspective and opinion. Varied opinions can help you understand a situation.",
"This is a passionate, creative day, Pisces. Your blood is hot and passion is on your mind. With luck, you have a significant other who can benefit! If not, you will have to find another way to burn off that energy. Invite a close friend for a jog. You're in the mood to socialize. If you can't have physical intimacy, be satisfied with emotional closeness.",
"You may be in a difficult position today, Pisces, as if you're being pulled in two directions with little say as to how things are supposed to end. The acting forces could be manipulative, so you should take special care that no one takes advantage of you. This may be easier said than done at a time like this.",
"Love is coming your way, Pisces. You're likely to be more passionate than usual. Be careful that your enthusiasm for the object of your desire doesn't go overboard. It's possible that you have an unrealistic view of the situation. It also could be that someone is leading you on and making you think something that isn't completely true.",
"Dependability and stability are key aspects of today, Pisces. Take action that will prove to others that these parts of your nature are fully functional. Other people may be stubborn and not easily moved. You will have to fight to get your viewpoint across. You may need to get out the bulldozer. Maintain tenderness in all your relations with others.",
"You may have a feeling that if you don't have something positive to say, you shouldn't say anything. This idea could keep you tongue-tied today, Pisces. If you're frustrated, angry, or hurt, address the issue openly. Don't feel like you have to be the one who cheers up everyone else. Let someone else have a turn for a change. You're only harming yourself by pretending that everything is OK when it isn't.",
"Someone or something may intimidate you and make you want to retreat, Pisces. But this person or situation is the very thing you need now in order to do what you have to do. Opportunities are there for you even though they may be disguised. Once you find them you will know. Have confidence that you're ready for the next step in your journey.",
"Let the child within come out and play, Pisces. Return to and relish your most primal state. Some of life's most important lessons are the ones you learned when you were a child. Return to that state of mind and embrace the simplicity of life you experienced then. Life is only complicated because you make it so. Remember what it was like to live without care and live that way again.",
"The thing you dread the most could be the very thing you need the most in your life, Pisces. You're at a point right now when the lessons that come might be hard to swallow, but they're necessary. Don't try to resist what you know you must face. Approach things with courage instead of fear and you can conquer anything. Once you climb the mountain, the rest is downhill.",
"Once you start talking about a certain topic, Pisces, it might be hard to stop, especially if the topic is you or one of your activities. A question about one aspect of your life may come up and you could have a sudden desire to tell your whole life story. Other people are going to want to voice their opinions, too, so take a breath and give them a chance.",
"If you don't agree with what the group is doing today, Pisces, don't feel like you have to join in. Earn their respect in your own way, not by forcing yourself into a mold you don't fit into. Maintain your integrity and act with confidence. If you're confident about your actions, others will put their confidence in you. Don't compromise your beliefs.",
"Today may feel like everything's coming to a head for you, Pisces. Even the slightest action might face resistance. The more stubborn your attitude, the harder it will be to progress. Your job is to infuse playfulness into every situation. Remind people that we're all on this stage together. We need to make the most of it, not shove each other out of the spotlight.",
"You may not feel in the mood to fight today, Pisces. If someone challenges you, talk your way out of it. You will probably be able to win any battle with your words. Try sensitive reasoning instead of open combat. Listen carefully to the concerns of the opposing side and make your move accordingly. This isn't a contest. It's a conversation among friends.",
"If you don't feel that you make enough money, this is the time to do something about it, Pisces. Are you sure you're doing everything you can to earn as much as possible? Perhaps you've wanted to change jobs for quite some time but something is holding you back. What do you think? Try to figure it out.",
"Children are highlighted today, Pisces, either yours or someone else's. You could be in one of the healing professions. If you're a nurse or doctor, you may have the opportunity to make a big difference in the life of one of your patients. If you're a parent, see if you can spend extra time with your children. You will all benefit from some quality time together.",
"Everyone knows that nothing can stop you when you're determined to get something done. As long as other people are on your side today, you will be amazed at all the things you can accomplish. But don't get too excited, Pisces, because it's time to take care of those thankless tasks that no one wants to deal with. You may need other people's help to get them done.",
"Your flamboyant approach may not get as much attention today as you'd like, Pisces. Don't push yourself to achieve something that isn't working. By insisting that something should be done your way, you'll only create enemies and bottlenecks in whatever task you're trying to accomplish. A thoughtful, conscious, reserved approach is going to win today.",
"Love is in the air for you, Pisces. You will be rewarded handsomely because you have so many things to offer. Spread your love everywhere. Skip from place to place and person to person, receiving smiles of pleasure. Put your worries aside. There's every reason to be happy. Laughter keeps you young.",
"This isn't a good day to get together with your romantic partner, Pisces, or even talk on the phone at length. Keep your conversations brief and make arrangements to meet in a few days. Your friend could be in a very agitated state of mind and might take offense at an innocent remark from you. This could cause an unpleasant quarrel. Be patient!",
"Are you picking up on some unsettling feelings from a friend who lives far away, Pisces? You may wonder if there's something wrong in this person's life. Perhaps you'd better give your friend a call. You'll probably find out that whatever is troubling him or her is minor and nothing that can't be dealt with. Anyway, it will be good to catch up!",
"Do you work with a lot of documents, Pisces? If so, you might find today that some of the papers you need are missing. They might seem to have vanished into a black hole. Look everywhere, of course, but chances are that someone has them and isn't aware of it. Don't be too shy to ask people about the papers. You could save yourself a lot of unnecessary effort this way.",
"An unexpected invitation to a social event could put you in touch with unusual, fascinating people, Pisces. Some of them may be involved in professions that interest you. Some may become your friends and others might prove to be valuable business contacts. New opportunities could come your way as a result. Whatever invitations come your way, don't turn them down. You might miss something wonderful.",
"A surge of passion could dominate your day unless you find an outlet for it, Pisces. An intimate evening with a lover would be a good idea. Creative passion is also strong, and you could be hit with sudden inspiration, perhaps influenced by distant places. Don't be afraid to take time out from your mundane chores to pursue this inspiration. Creativity is as important as anything else.",
"You may be a bit depressed today if you and your partner are going through a difficult time. Maybe there's something unspoken that brings tension and awkwardness into your life together. Try to find the root of the problem. It will only get worse if you don't talk about it. Don't get too emotional when you bring it up. Just ask if your partner is bothered by something.",
"Today it looks like you might not be able to attend a group activity that you've been anticipating, Pisces. Other pressing matters may demand your immediate attention. This could prove frustrating. However, if you work quickly and efficiently, you might be able to make it after all. Budget your time carefully and get to it!",
"Extend the day by getting up earlier than usual, Pisces. Even though it may be hard to leave the comfort of your bed, the rewards will be many. The celestial energy beckons you to get up and join the activities of the day. You'll be much more productive and accomplish a lot by the end of the day.",
"Everyone is likely to be making demands on you right now, which can have you in a dither. A career success could be offset by an upset with a partner over a miscommunication. This should be worked out, but it might take the wind out of your sails if you let it, Pisces. It would be a good idea to derail any upset before it runs you down. Invite your partner out to celebrate!",
"You may be confused by your heart, Pisces. It may be extremely frustrating when you can't keep a tight rein on your emotions. This internal conflict is a signal that there's a lesson to learn. Perhaps your heart knows something that your conscious mind hasn't yet realized.",
"There's a chance that incredible luck will befall you, Pisces, but nothing will come without hard work on your part. Don't expect someone else to hand you the treasure chest. You have the map in your hand, so follow it. Once you start, you may realize that you're much closer than you think. It's up to you to make the journey. There's a great deal of help for you along the way.",
"Taking time alone is essential for everyone, Pisces, but recognize when you're isolating yourself to the point where it's unhealthy. If you ask why you're taking this time and answer because you're avoiding something or someone, you need to reconsider. Things will only build and get worse under these conditions. You begin to work things out by facing whatever it is that's upsetting you.",
"If you meet new people today, Pisces, be careful. Some can appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing. While this may be intriguing, it can lead to trouble and hurt you if you aren't careful. Stick to your usual standards and ethics. If danger excites you too much, it may be time to make some changes in your life.",
"Relationships may be a bit difficult, Pisces, so don't force pleasantry if it doesn't come naturally. Your motto today should be, \"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\" Perhaps this leaves you tongue-tied, but that's fine. If you need to spend the day alone, so be it. Don't be social if you don't feel like it.",
"Don't delude yourself, Pisces. While it can be a real temptation to see what you want to see, there's danger in doing so. A pipe dream can only last so long. It's never permanent! Rather than playing this kind of trick on yourself, take off the blinders and face what's before you. Even if it hurts, it will likely be far less painful now than later.",
"Whatever your situation, Pisces, today you could encounter someone exciting who stirs a powerful romantic attraction within you. This can be delightful, and there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the company, but be a little cautious before taking any action. Get to know this person better before you decide on any sort of involvement, casual or serious. All may not be as it seems.",
"You might feel cheerful and generous today, Pisces. Helping others will probably suit you, and matters will move along smoothly. If there are outstanding projects from earlier, tackle them first. It's an opportune time to get caught up on challenges. Don't hesitate to lend a hand if you're approached or notice someone in need. This will benefit them as well as you.",
"With some leisure time on your hands, you'll find an opportunity to start fresh in some area that has challenged you, Pisces. Find the courage to examine your attitudes toward adverse situations. Armed with your new knowledge, you might have a new insight that allows you to approach an old problem in a different way. You'll discover that you have more power than you thought.",
"Today you may feel a powerful need to be with friends, Pisces, but once you seek them out, you may not enjoy their company very much. Someone is in a bad mood, and being with this person could put a damper on your day. It might be better to take some time for yourself, perhaps go for a workout. This will enable you to get some exercise and increase your self-confidence as well.",
"Your thoughts are emotionally charged, Pisces, but you'll find that this can be used to your advantage. You have a great deal of knowledge at your disposal, and you aren't afraid to throw in a little drama just for the fun of it. Your dramatic flair will take you far on a day like today. Don't hesitate to get exactly what you want.",
"A lot of energy might be expended on an artistic project that you probably won't like, Pisces. You could get halfway through and then toss it away. This could be disheartening as you could lament the time and effort lost. But this happens to all great artists. Go ahead and start over. Maybe this time you'll accomplish what you want. Don't settle for mediocre. Go for the gold.",
"A surprising phone call might come today from a close friend or business or romantic partner, Pisces. This person might have encountered an unexpected upset and need to concentrate on getting it together again. An offer to help might meet with scant enthusiasm, as this person may prefer to take care of things alone. The trick is to be supportive and not take on the troubles as your own.",
"This is a great day for you, Pisces. You'll find that long-term trends are coming together harmoniously. Connections are being made when you share good times and laughter with close friends and other people. Stick with the things that feel right. You have love and bravery to share with the world, so don't be afraid to go out and conquer. Take action and be strong.",
"Make some room for long communications with good friends, Pisces. This is an important day to get the word out to people you love. Keep things light and energetic, which you do well anyway. Express your showmanship and make sure your bright presence lights up every room you enter. The world is your stage, so act the role you enjoy the most - your true self.",
"If you've been planning to set off on a trip soon, Pisces, make a list of what you need to do beforehand and check off each task as you complete it. Otherwise you might panic at the last minute because you've forgotten something important. Stay calm even if it seems impossible. You're less likely to forget anything if you stay focused.",
"Romance is in the air and you must be breathing a lot of it today, Pisces. Your blood is boiling, your passion surging, and a romantic dinner for two is in the cards. You'll be inclined to shop for clothes, but curb your appetite for material goods. What you really want doesn't come in a box, so why waste your money?",
"Loving care is prescribed for someone in your family, Pisces. Offer a bowl of soup and some tea, but beyond that try and stay out of the way. Sometimes uninterrupted quiet is the best cure of all. You could use a bit of this yourself. Why not curl up with a good book? Even if it's the middle of the day, draw the shades and pretend it's night.",
"Attempts to balance emotions with logic may not succeed today, particularly where family is concerned, Pisces. Members of your household may be upset, and you might not be able to cheer them up. Perhaps all you can do is leave them alone for a while to think. Only they can understand their feelings and discern the right way to proceed. Let them know you care, then back off.",
"Are you working at home today, Pisces? This won't make your efforts any less intense, especially if your work involves writing or speaking on the phone. Whatever you're doing will probably seem urgent. You need to do things carefully or you may miss important details or express yourself vaguely. Slow down and don't work too quickly. It may take longer, but you won't regret it.",
"Concerns about your home or mother may mean you have to deal with some rather unpleasant or untrustworthy people. Lack of knowledge could have you in a quandary about how to address the situation. It would be a good idea to prepare by gathering all the facts you might need. Stay centered and focused, Pisces, and use your inner strength to hold out for the best for all concerned.",
"You can cruise from left to right and front to rear and back again, Pisces. There's plenty of fuel for your fire today, and so you should take this opportunity to move forward toward your goals. Connecting with others is an important aspect of the day. Do your best to work with like-minded individuals.",
"This could prove a busy day for you, Pisces. You may attend at least one party, or perhaps just meet with a group of friends for drinks or dinner. On this occasion you're apt to find the banter and camaraderie shared with people you care about not only stimulating but also relaxing. You could also receive a lot of useful information.",
"A visit from a relative or neighbor early in the day could put you in a fantastic mood. Perhaps this person has some interesting news, encouraging words, or maybe a gift. Listen and enjoy, Pisces, but beware of idle gossip. Some of what you hear is unlikely to be true, so it's best to keep it all to yourself. In the evening, go out on the town!",
"You may have some trouble getting out of bed today due to a desire to let the world carry on without your help for a while. Pisces, you can yield to that lazy urge today, for the aspects are likely to assist you in fulfilling your goals. Take advantage of some time off to rest or perhaps tidy your nest. You might want to make that bed, too.",
"The fire within you is burning extra hot, Pisces, so make the most of this incredible internal furnace. Treat yourself to some new attire and proudly show it off tonight. Take the lead on projects that might be floundering. You have power behind your words and actions today, so use it for the highest good.",
"Bask in each new day, Pisces. Do your best to spread your sunshine, but don't be surprised if someone challenges the way you think. There are stubborn forces out there working to steer you in the direction that they'd like you to go. Make sure that you're the one who remains in control. Keep up your positive outlook!",
"Some unexpected but welcome communications could come your way, probably from a lover or close friend. Planning for a pleasant, exciting journey is indicated. Today you relate well to others, friendships grow closer, romantic relationships become more intimate. Someone close to you could move to your neighborhood. Plan a small gathering for tonight.",
"A couple, perhaps friends, could visit today. Perhaps you've moved into a new home or redecorated and want to show them around. They'll be impressed and you'll enjoy the company. Do they share an interest in dreams with you? The subject of dreams may come up in the conversation. You could be surprised at the insights your friends have.",
"Creative writing or speaking projects might take up a lot of your time today. You could channel not only your mind but also your very being into your work. You'll probably be so caught up in what you're doing that you have difficulty returning to the real world when you're done. Never mind. You'll probably be pleased with the results.",
"You'll feel forceful today, so use this energy to plow through any projects and get ahead in the game. You're definitely the ruler of everything you come in contact with. But even good rulers can be overthrown. People don't like arrogant leaders. Don't assume that someone is wrong just because he or she doesn't agree with your point of view.",
"Efforts to advance your career that you've made over the past few weeks could finally bear fruit. Success and good fortune are strongly indicated where business and money are concerned. Worries over finances disappear. You could receive public recognition of some kind, particularly from higher-ups. Some benefit through contracts or legal papers is also indicated. This is a satisfying, profitable time.",
"A rush of communication heightens love and romance today. Feelings and memories are willingly shared. Either you or your partner could reveal something that the other didn't know, which could strengthen the bond between you. Some of what's exchanged might be a little surprising, but your relationship should be much better for all the open, honest, and loving communication.",
"The fog has finally lifted and you're able to see clearly again. Make sure you're awake and alert, because the gun is about to go off and the starting gates are about to open. You have the ability to take the lead, especially when it comes to matters involving love and romance. Your creativity is strong, and you'll lead the pack almost effortlessly.",
"Your emotions receive a boost of support from those around you. Be careful that you don't let this energy go to your head. This is a good day to sit back and gain perspective on things instead of assuming you have all the answers. Opportunities will come to you when you join a team of progressive thinkers who aren't afraid to push beyond current boundaries.",
"This is a fantastic day for you, so celebrate. You're the star of the show, and you'll be up on stage more than usual. People will look up to you and respect you for your incredible leadership skills. Be confident and express yourself from your heart. Actions should run smoothly. You can accomplish quite a bit. Don't waste this day. Do some creative work.",
"A social event today could put you in touch with fascinating new people in interesting fields. Intriguing discussions could take place throughout the evening. The only problem is if you go there with a partner, you probably won't see much of him or her. You might get involved in separate conversations that last for hours. You'll have a lot to share later!",
"Let your heart shine. Love surrounds you like a beautiful pink cloud, and you can't help but attract people to you. Take romance to a higher level with someone really special tonight. You'll find that whatever you give will come back to you tenfold. Your aura glows brightly with emotion, so let it light your way.",
"Have you been working toward public acknowledgement of some sort? If so, you may receive it today. You've been working hard and produced results that aren't likely to go unnoticed. Expect some compliments, a lot of praise, and maybe even a moment of fame. Needless to say, this is going to give your self-confidence a boost.",
"People of great power and drive may pop out of the woodwork today. They'll confront you directly and perhaps challenge you in some way. You may be at a climactic point right now, and feel like you're at a junction. Make adjustments now. Realize that change is a key ingredient for growth. Upheaval and action may be necessary.",
"A new romance is definitely in the air. This could be a renewal of he romance within a current relationship or, if you're single, someone new and exciting might cross your path. This person could be from a distant place or in a profession such as law or education. Whatever your situation, the feeling is going to persist at least through next month.",
"Friends and lovers alike may take unfair advantage of your good nature. Some may want you to do them favors. Others might want to use you as a sounding board for their problems. You won't want to turn them away. If you can't avoid them, you should learn to say, \"I'll help you later!\" You can only be in one place at a time, and there are only 24 hours in a day.",
"A temporary separation between you and a lover could have you experiencing mixed feelings. You may need some time to yourself, but you'll miss your friend! Your insecurity could come up, and you may start wondering if there's someone else with your partner. Concentrate on your projects and enjoy the peace and quiet. You're making mountains out of molehills.",
"You're romantic by nature, but today you're probably more interested in sensuality than roses and champagne. Even the idea of inviting seduction seems too insipid right now. You're more inclined to action. This is OK your lover is in the same frame of mind. Use your intuition to judge. If not, you might have to go for the champagne and roses after all.",
"Today you may come down from your recent high with a thud. If you feel irritable dealing with everyday chores, you're not alone. Your mood may be exacerbated by a visit from an even grumpier friend. If you're feeling cooped up with the detritus of family life, take a break and go for a long walk to clear your head and raise your spirits. Tomorrow is another day.",
"You may be expecting some visitors. Happy as you are about this, you may be feeling overwhelmed by what remains to be done. Pace yourself. These friends are coming to see you, not check under the beds for dust bunnies. It's more important to enjoy their company than stress about housekeeping minutia. Leave some time to relax so you're refreshed for their visit.",
"Have you been thinking about adopting a pet? If so, today is a great day to go to the shelter and rescue one. You'll know which one to choose, as the animal will probably choose you! If this is what you want, don't let minor objections get in the way. A pet can be a wonderful source of companionship, entertainment, and unconditional love.",
"The energy is unusually slow, causing you to drag and your productivity to suffer. There isn't much you can do about it. Prioritize your tasks so you accomplish what absolutely needs to be done. Everything else will have to wait until your \"get up and go\" returns tomorrow. In the meantime, energize yourself as much as possible with good nutrition and a brisk walk.",
"You're in a fun and festive mood with today's planetary aspects. Tonight you should plan a house full of people, because you're going to need an audience. Your flair for drama is working overtime. You'll have jokes to tell and anecdotes to pass on. Your guests will appreciate the free floorshow!",
"This is a day for good news, particularly regarding the home. It's likely that some positive changes are occurring or are about to occur. You may be considering a move or a major renovation. Whatever it is, all signs indicate that the changes are for the better. One way or another, by this time next year you'll be living in a bigger, better house.",
"You may have so much fun today that you forget to check on the happiness of the people around you. You should feel quite a surge of strength because of the energy of today, but realize that other people may have a hard time keeping up with your fantastic pace. Stop and take a break in order to allow other people to catch up.",
"Success in a creative field and possible public acknowledgment could come your way. Close friends and romantic partners will be very happy for you and might even throw a little celebration of some kind. Phone calls with congratulations may come from distant states or even foreign countries. This could be something you've been working toward for a long time, so relax and enjoy it.",
"Your thinking is right in line with the group dynamic today, and you'll find working with a team to be extremely rewarding. The more you express your thoughts to the group, the more physical support you'll receive for your work. You'll find that your actions are diplomatic and you're able to see both sides of issues. Your decisions are fair and honest.",
"Your creative impulse should be high today. You might decide to try some writing. You may have a particular subject in mind to write about. You could also take a class in a subject that interests you, or do a little research on your own. You might consider some long-distance travel for pleasure as much as for learning. The sky's the limit.",
"A visitor to your home might bring unreliable information. Don't take at face value whatever this person says. As far as romance is concerned, your passions are high and your need for intimacy about the same. It's unlikely that you'll have any truly romantic encounters today, at least satisfying ones. If the opportunity comes your way, it might be best to make a date for a later time.",
"Responsibilities at home may weigh on your mind today and interfere with other obligations. This could cause some inner conflict, but you have a personal life and it's important to take care of these things, too. Upsets in your circle of friends could distract and stress you. Make an effort to balance it all and you'll make it through the day.",
"A business or romantic partner could either contact you or return from a long trip with great news. Perhaps your friend has had a lucky break of some kind that betters life in general for both of you. Success and good fortune are indicated today, as are happiness, enthusiasm, and optimism. If you have a project you've wanted to start, do it now.",
"You may feel like there's absolutely nowhere to turn. Reality is a scary thing to face. The last thing you want to do is be serious. But you're finding it difficult to get satisfaction from your fantasy world. Your dreams beckon to you, but you're afraid to give in to that temptation because you feel a strong sense of duty to other people and places.",
"Your boisterous, generous attitude is inspiring and welcomed by others. There are also some people who consider your behavior ostentatious or arrogant. You may wonder how this is possible, since your intentions are good. You want people to share in the love and good times. You're attentive to others' feelings. Sit down and talk with people one-on-one to understand how they feel.",
"You've met some strange people who have greatly influenced your attitude about your marriage or partnership. Some people have been pushing you toward more freedom. These people have been influenced by the planetary alignments, but that's no reason you have to be. Freedom or lack of it is completely subjective.",
"A social event, perhaps related to business, could put you in touch with an old friend or two you haven't seen for a long time. You'll have a wonderful time catching up. In fact, you have more in common now than you did before. If you're single, you might think of this person as a potential romantic partner. Go slowly, but have fun!",
"You might have a few projects in mind that you'll want to work on today. Your mind is especially quick and agile, and you have a lot of great ideas that can make your efforts turn out the way you want. Conversations with those close to you may provide even more possibilities. Whatever you choose to work on, you should be pleased with the results.",
"You might have to work just a little harder to make money now. This might involve putting in extra time on a task, or it could simply mean that you have to make a few extra trips to the bank. Artistic insights might not be coming as profusely as usual, but this is all right. Relax and let things be, and the ideas will start coming again.",
"You could be cleaning your house when you hear some wonderful news about money today. This could make your day. You won't want to do much housework afterward. Don't worry - the dirt isn't going anywhere! Instead of feeling guilty about letting the housework go, go out and celebrate with a close friend or your partner. You deserve it. Have a great evening!",
"You may have some strong hesitation during the day. You may have to cover up the truth or say it out loud. If so, say what's on your mind. You'll be supported by the planets, which will help you formulate your ideas in a way that won't shock people. In fact, you might even sway some of them to your point of view!",
"Today you should feel romantic and passionate and want to get together with your love partner. You'll probably do that, but it may be difficult and only arranged at the last minute. Don't panic if you can't reach your friend during the early part of the day. Don't give up. You'll have a great evening.",
"Your audience will be attentive to you today. Take the lead and others will follow. Be yourself and project your voice into the auditorium of eager listeners. Information will flow freely, and you shouldn't discount any ideas from the peanut gallery. Be open to questions and comments from others. Their participation is vital to your performance.",
"You may feel the urge to put your loved one on a pedestal today. You want to see him or her as the perfect mate for you. You're willing to go to great lengths to bring this person pleasure. You're wearing your rose-colored glasses, so very little will convince you of anything but the fact that things are perfect and beautiful.",
"Use today's electric feeling to fuel your passion. A subtle tension has been building for some time. You've reached a critical turning point. Don't shy away from adventure because you fear failure. Change and open up your heart to the world. You may hesitate to make a move because you don't want to make waves, but how else are you going to advance in life?",
"Today you may start to see your friends in a new light. Perhaps their accomplishments have aroused your admiration. A special person could seem more perfect than ever, and you could suddenly view your friend through a romantic haze once more. Bear in mind that your view of these people only mirrors your view of yourself. Recognize your merits as well others'.",
"Today your mind may be on romance. If you're married, you'll grow closer to your partner. If you're single but involved, the relationship could move to the next level of commitment. If you aren't involved, expect to meet someone new and exciting. Warm feelings of unity and intimacy could fill your heart. See and accept your partner as he or she is.",
"You may experience some push and pull today. One minute you feel like you should sit back and wait for things to go your way, and the next you feel a stick poking you to get moving. Life is a delicate balance of incorporating these two modes of operation. Neither way is more correct, so recognize and honor both.",
"Inspiration and insights that come through dreams could give you the boost you need to get your career on track. You may have been kicking different ideas around for a while, but what you realize today could motivate you to act. Formulate a strategy before you begin. As long as you make the effort to stay focused, efficient, and practical, whatever you decide today might work.",
"You like to recycle in your home and your workplace. Be a part of the solution instead of the problem by picking up after yourself and making sure that you aren't leaving a mess wherever you go. The state of the environment is more of a concern every day. It's up to each individual to make a difference.",
"Tap into your internal resources. Listen to your deepest, strongest feelings and take things slowly. Plan your actions and consider the emotions of others before you take the first step. Take advantage of the pauses in your day. Enjoy the rest and use the time to plan ahead instead of acting rashly and running full throttle to the next task.",
"Things are moving in opposite directions, yet you can relate and benefit from all of them. There's nothing wrong with keeping your options open. Some people like to stick with one game, while you like to play multiple hands at once. Don't let others make you feel like you need to change your way as long as you're confident that things are working for you.",
"Love of someone from far away could be very much on your mind today, and perhaps love for the place where the person lives. You may be bored with your routine and anxious to embrace adventure. This is a good time to plan a vacation, particularly if accompanied by a partner or close friend. Your artistic instincts could also be inspired by geniuses from other cultures.",
"An old friend you haven't seen in a long time could suddenly reappear. You'll be surprised by this person's achievements. This meeting or the circumstances surrounding it could mark a turning point for you. Perhaps this person inspires you, or people you meet through him or her make a difference to you. This is going to be a strange, significant day. Make the most of it!",
"Strong psychic impressions about absent friends or family members may come to you today. All are apt to be positive, though you might find it disconcerting. You might even think it more so if you learn your intuition was right! This tendency may continue for a while. Your sensitivity to others' thoughts and feelings is increasing. It can contribute to your understanding of them. Make the most of it.",
"A lot of paperwork that you need to complete could have you nervous and stressed. You might experience some headaches. Don't sacrifice your well-being for this. You won't lose your focus if you have to put off some tasks until tomorrow. Calls or visitors could also get on your nerves. Turn off the phone and tell people you'll visit later. They'll understand.",
"Be careful about declaring your love for someone when you haven't spent enough time with him or her to make that call. You may base this impulse on superficial encounters and brief conversations. You may not have the long history or deep discussions needed to know if this person is as ideal for you as you think. Don't be fooled by fast talk and high fashion.",
"You could feel especially amorous today. If you're romantically involved, you could have an overwhelming urge for an intimate dinner with your significant other. If you're uninvolved, expect that status to change shortly. A new person could cross your path and sweep you off your feet. Or you could see an old friend in a new light. Be prepared for anything.",
"Money or other resources could be made available to you today so you can increase your career prospects or advance in your occupation. You'll find this very encouraging, as you'll throw a lot of energy into this interest. This is the time to be ambitious. You have what it takes to push forward with just about anything you want to do.",
"Today you'll change your approach to relationships. In the past, they were based on feelings, but now you'll decide that they should be more rational. You might feel that this sudden change of attitude could detract from your happiness, but it could also lead to stronger, more stable relationships.",
"You should expect to feel warmth in your contact with other people today. Your relations will have something particularly tender and caring about them. It's like people are suddenly much more attentive and sensitive. The universe is like one big, happy family. You can confide in other people. Don't be afraid to talk about your most intimate feelings with a friend.",
"It's time to brush up on your computer skills. Technology is here to stay, so you might as well embrace it rather than resist. Your mind is eager to absorb new information. This means that you can learn the more intricate aspects of computer technology. Once you do, you'll enjoy browsing websites, shopping online, and emailing your friends near and far.",
"Your parents or another couple close to you may be quarreling, and you might be expected to take sides. Don't do it! It's better to stand aside and let them work it out for themselves while reminding them that you care for them both. The best you can do under these circumstances is try to help mediate a compromise, but finding a win/win situation could be hard.",
"Delays seem to rule the day, and there's no getting around them. Traffic snarls plague the commute and calls don't get returned. You feel as though you're spending the day stuck in a revolving door, whirling around but getting nowhere. Take heart and do your best to get through with some of your humor intact. Chocolate helps. Tomorrow will be better!",
"Usually you have a strong intuitive bond with those close to you, but today you might feel like that part of your brain has shut down. You could get confusing messages, or you could pick up nothing at all. You haven't lost your gift so don't worry about it. You'll have to rely on words for now!",
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, as the saying goes. You're likely to receive some good news today. Don't second-guess it, or worry if you're worthy of it. Accept it for what it is, though it might be worth taking some time to consider why you feel unworthy in the first place.",
"New winds will begin to blow away the black clouds that have been hovering over you lately. What more could you want? Today will seem like a walk in the park compared to days past! You'll breathe better and come home feeling rested. Try to interact more with the people around you. They will appreciate it if you express genuine interest in their opinions.",
"Be careful about opening your mouth in situations in which it isn't appropriate. When the conversation lags, you feel it's your duty to pipe up. By doing so, you may launch the conversation onto an inappropriate topic. You may want to say something just so you can shift the focus to you. The better choice is to allow the silence to sit peacefully.",
"You may feel weighed down by the emotional pall hanging over everything. Don't let this feeling overwhelm you, although at times this may be impossible. A good friend could call on you for help and emotional support. Don't end up turning the focus around and talking only about your experiences. Loyalty and compassion are keys for today.",
"A touch of melancholy and moodiness might have you feeling distanced from your entourage and so you could throw yourself into solitary activities. Your concentration may not be what it should be. Get out and take a long walk or treat yourself to a meal at your favorite restaurant. Your mood will pass by tomorrow. You need to get through today!",
"If you aren't romantically involved, don't be surprised if romance comes your way today, perhaps in your neighborhood. Even if you are involved, you'll make a new friend. You're likely to meet someone special outside in the open air and close to a crowd of people. Therefore, this isn't a good day to stay inside, even if the weather's bad. Go see what the Universe has in store for you.",
"Congratulations to you! Career progress is in the wind! If you've wanted to create a dream career, you'll be able to do so today. If you've been hoping to start your own business, don't wait another moment. The next year should be a successful and profitable one for you, although not without its surprises.",
"Ordering one item from the menu isn't going to satisfy you today. You need a buffet table where you can try everything - either that or an eight-course meal served with a smile. You're happy to share your meal with others as long as you can have a bite of what everyone else is having as well. This is your day to skip around, try new things, and explore different perspectives.",
"You might be more energetic than you've felt in a long time. It's the perfect day to get busy with tasks, projects, and housework. You'll breeze through most things in no time and enjoy them. Resist any temptation to procrastinate! If you put things off, you'll miss the current cosmic support. Make a list of things to do and start. You'll be done before you know it!",
"Instead of directing all your energy outward and dominating the conversation with your ideas, consider listening. Let ideas flow your way. Be receptive to opinions and ideas. A wonderful mental and emotional expansion occurs when you receive instead of being so concerned about projecting out. Be more focused on what's happening on the inside instead of so worried about events on the outside."]
